\begin{abstract}
Gravity occupies a unique position among the fundamental forces: it is dynamical spacetime itself, requiring self-consistency at every point. General relativity encodes this through field closure, the requirement that the metric remain non-degenerate ($\det(g) \neq 0$) everywhere. In tetrad formulation, closure forces four basis vectors at each point to span the tangent space completely, defining a tetrahedron at each field node. Ghost-free bimetric gravity (Hassan-Rosen 2012) couples two such tetrad fields through shared boundary faces. Field coupling closure in $(3{+}1)$ dimensions determines a unique minimal topology: the stellated octahedron, two tetrahedra with opposite orientations coupled at a shared origin.

Deriving a covariant scalar-tensor action from that coupling hierarchy yields quantitative predictions. The topological constant $k = 4$ (from simplex packing in $(3{+}1)$ dimensions) predicts the neutron lifetime beam-bottle discrepancy (1.084\% vs observed 1.081\%, agreement to 0.3\%) and Milky Way rotation velocity (225 km/s predicted vs 229 observed, 1.6\% with zero free parameters). This constitutes bidirectional validation across 36 orders of magnitude, from nuclear physics ($10^{-15}$~m) to galactic dynamics ($10^{21}$~m), with zero adjustable parameters.

When dual tetrahedral field regions couple, the interaction occurs at three structural levels: field existence (1), propagation through vierbein faces ($k = 4$), and Hassan-Rosen bimetric channels ($k^2 = 16$). The coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2 = 21$ is not phenomenological but the architecture that field coupling closure requires. Structural identification of the 16 bimetric interaction channels with the coupled face channels of the stellated octahedron yields a zero-parameter covariant completion, distinct from Hassan-Rosen bimetric gravity which contains five free functions. The resulting scalar-tensor action passes 14 empirical tests spanning GW speed (exact to $10^{-15}$), Mercury precession, lunar laser ranging, wide binary plateaus, rotation curves, and cosmological expansion, with zero fitted parameters compared to the standard paradigm's 25+.

The coupling hierarchy yields both constants from the same topology: $G = (17/13)\alpha^{21} \hbar c/m_e^2$ from the coupling depth (0.12\% tree-level, 0.001\% one-loop), and $1/\alpha = 137.036$ from the interaction breadth (0.00021\% agreement). The pattern across independent tests demonstrates that the missing 85\% attributed to dark matter reflects missing structure in how we model field dynamics, not missing particles. Fundamental constants are topological consequences of how gravitational fields couple in $(3{+}1)$ dimensions.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The fundamental constants of physics have been measured with extraordinary precision. Newton's gravitational constant $G$ has been the subject of increasingly refined experiments since Cavendish's 1798 torsion balance measurement, yet for over three centuries no theory has calculated its value from first principles. The Standard Model of particle physics requires over two dozen such parameters~\cite{pdg2024}, each determined by experiment but not derived from any deeper principle. That these constants take the values they do is what makes atoms stable, chemistry possible, and structure viable at every scale. Explaining why they take precisely these values has remained one of the deepest open questions in physics.

The stakes extend beyond unexplained constants. Galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background all indicate that approximately 85\% of the universe's gravitating mass has never been directly detected~\cite{pdg2024}. Four decades of dedicated searches have produced no confirmed dark matter particle. The assumption underlying standard cosmology is that spacetime is a structureless continuum whose gravitational response is fully characterized by a single constant, $G$. But if the gravitational field possesses internal coupling structure that modifies its response at different scales, the question changes: is the missing 85\% missing mass, or is it missing structure?

In other branches of physics, the relationship between internal topology and observable properties is well established. The molecular lattice of a ruby crystal determines the discrete energy levels available to electrons passing through it; the result is stimulated emission, the physical basis of the laser. Semiconductor band gaps, superconducting transition temperatures, and phonon spectra all follow from the coupling architecture of their respective lattices. In each case, the internal topology of the medium determines the measurable constants that describe it. Just as the angles of a crystal are determined by its lattice, the constants of nature may be determined by the topology of the gravitational field. They would not be free parameters that could have been different; they would be structural consequences of living in three spatial dimensions.

Gravity, too, possesses an internal coupling structure. The tetrad formalism~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984} defines the ``square root of the metric,'' $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\,e^a_\mu\,e^b_\nu$, decomposing each metric into a local frame whose spatial triad defines a tetrahedron~\cite{barbieri1998}, the minimal solid in three dimensions. Ghost-free bimetric gravity~\cite{hassan2012,hinterbichler2012} operates with two such tetrad fields, $g = E^T\eta\,E$ and $f = L^T\eta\,L$, coupled at a single interaction vertex through a potential with five free coefficients $\beta_0$ through $\beta_4$. Ghost-freedom requires opposite spatial orientations for the two tetrads~\cite{alexander2014}; general covariance requires them to share compatible $(3{+}1)$ decompositions~\cite{hassankocic2018}. Together, these constraints define a dual tetrahedron field topology whose field coupling hierarchy has not been systematically characterized. This paper reads that hierarchy and shows what it produces.

Gravity occupies a unique position among the fundamental forces: it is not a field on a background spacetime but the dynamical spacetime itself, and it must therefore be self-consistent at every point with no external structure to enforce coherence. General relativity encodes this through the non-degeneracy of the metric ($\det(g) \neq 0$), which requires the field to close: to define a complete coupling structure at every point, with no gaps and no missing directions. When field configurations couple, they must settle into a compatible state with consistent geometry across all coupling channels. In this paper, we refer to this process as \emph{field closure} (FC$_{\Sigma}$, field closure at the boundary $\Sigma$): the continuous enforcement of self-consistency that the gravitational field must satisfy. In the tetrad formalism, these four directions constitute a local vierbein $e^a_\mu$ at each point~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}. The simplex theorem (Section~\ref{subsec:k4}) establishes that four faces are the minimum needed to enclose volume in three dimensions; the vierbein therefore defines a tetrahedral field region at each spacetime point. Neighboring regions couple through shared boundary faces, and the pattern of these face couplings constitutes the field's topology. If this topology is constrained tightly enough by self-consistency, the fundamental constants may not be free parameters at all but consequences of how the gravitational field couples to itself.

Atomic structure emerges from electromagnetic field coupling: the interaction between charged particles produces persistent configurations with definite internal topology, and that topology determines measurable properties from spectral lines to chemical bonds. Gravitational field coupling produces structure by the same principle. When field regions interact through the $(3{+}1)$ tetrad frames that general relativity already requires, the coupling creates a self-consistent field architecture whose topology is not a free choice but a consequence of the field's own consistency requirements.

The physical picture begins with field packing. Gravitational field regions, being distributed and locally coupled, pack in three dimensions. The simplex theorem establishes that $k = 4$ faces are both necessary and sufficient to enclose a volume in three dimensions, and these four faces define a tetrahedral field chamber, the minimal solid enclosing the coupling region. A single tetrahedral field chamber, however, is not self-consistent. Four independent arguments, two from textbook physics and two from the bimetric gravity literature, all demonstrate this: spinor theory demands the SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) double cover~\cite{weinberg1995,geroch1968}; Ashtekar's chiral decomposition requires both self-dual and anti-self-dual connections~\cite{ashtekar1986}; ghost-free bimetric gravity requires two dynamical metrics~\cite{hassan2012}; and stability analysis confirms that a single orientation produces a scalar ghost~\cite{alexander2014}. Self-consistency requires a second tetrahedron with opposite orientation, coupled to the first at a shared center: the Field Origin. The resulting structure, two interlocking tetrahedra sharing a common center, is the stellated octahedron~\cite{coxeter1973}.

The field coupling structure of this stellated octahedron is a polynomial in $k = (3{+}1) = 4$:
\begin{equation}
f(k) = 1 + k + k^2
\end{equation}
whose three terms correspond to structures already recognized in the literature: the Field Origin ($1$)~\cite{hinterbichler2012}, the vierbein face ($k = 4$)~\cite{mtw1973}, and the full bimetric field coupling ($k^2 = 16$)~\cite{hassan2012}. The stellated octahedron has three structural regions (TetA, the Field Origin, TetB), and evaluating $f(k)$ in each yields three integers: $f(4) = 21$ (the full coupling depth), $f(4)|_{s=0} = 17$ (the coupling capacity at the Field Origin), and $f(4)|_{s=-1} = 13$ (the spatial structure of the inverted sector). These three integers, together with the quantum scale $\hbar c / m_e^2$, determine $G$:
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{17}{13} \times \alpha^{21} \times \frac{\hbar c}{m_e^2}
\label{eq:G}
\end{equation}

\end{tabular}\\[4pt]

\end{center}

The polynomial is not fitted to $G$. It is the field coupling structure that the stellated octahedron's topology requires. The entire framework rests on a single discrete fact: space has three dimensions ($d = 3$). The topology determines every pure number in the framework, the integers ($4, 17, 21, 137$), the ratios ($17/13$), and the coupling exponents, through geometry alone. These numbers carry no units; expressing them in physical units requires three measured quantities: $\hbar$, $c$, and one mass scale $m_e$. The topology then recovers $m_e$ from an independent route to 0.1\% (Section~\ref{sec:electron-mass}), confirming that the framework predicts its own dimensional anchor. Zero free parameters are adjusted. The test is simple: start from $d = 3$, follow the chain, and if any single prediction disagrees with measurement, the framework fails without adjustment. There are no dials to turn.

If this field topology derives $G$, does it also explain other fundamental relationships? The answer, developed in Sections~\ref{sec:five} through~\ref{sec:conclusion}, is that the same dual tetrahedron field topology produces quantitative results across classical, relativistic, and quantum physics. The inverse square law follows from field spreading in three dimensions. Mass-energy equivalence follows from the bimetric field structure and its two closure speeds. The force hierarchy follows from the depth of field coupling within the 21-level structure. Electron spin $\hbar/2$ follows from the face ratio of the stellated octahedron. Dark matter observations are accounted for by the constitutive law that field closure imposes. These are not separate explanations for separate phenomena. They are aspects of one field topology, the topology that yields $G$.

\subsection{Scope and Limits}
\label{subsec:limits}

This paper presents what the dual tetrahedron topology explains about fundamental physics. It does not claim to explain everything. The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is derived in Section~\ref{sec:alpha} from the Hamiltonian interaction states of the bimetric topology, yielding $1/\alpha = 137.036$ to 0.00021\%. The electron mass $m_e$ is derived in Section~\ref{sec:electron-mass} from the exactly determined closure system. No particle-physics input is required; the Hubble constant $H$ enters as a cosmological observable and is itself predicted by the topology (Section~\ref{subsec:hubble}). The cosmological constant, the strong force, and the weak force are not directly addressed. The goal is clarity about what the topology does explain, not a claim to have solved all of physics.

\subsection{Overview}

\section{Why Gravity Has Topology}
\label{sec:theory}

This section establishes that topology is not an addition to general relativity but what GR already requires. The gravitational field propagates (LIGO confirmed this in 2015). Propagation requires neighbors (the wave equation demands it). And neighbors that must be self-consistent at every point, with no external structure to enforce coherence, must achieve field closure (GR has enforced this for a century through non-degeneracy). Once there is structure, counting begins. Numbers emerge from counting, not from fitting. Everything that follows derives from the field dynamics of one geometric structure: the stellated octahedron.

\subsection{The Gravitational Field Propagates}
\label{subsec:propagates}

General Relativity describes gravity through the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, a dynamical field satisfying Einstein's equations. This is standard physics, confirmed by a century of observations. GR works beautifully. But when we ask how the gravitational field couples to itself, how one region of spacetime influences its neighbors, the answer lies in a reformulation that many physicists learn but few fully explore: tetrad gravity.

Tetrad gravity, also called vierbein or frame-field gravity, is textbook material~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}. It describes the same physics as metric GR but makes the field's internal structure explicit. The tetrad is defined as the ``square root of the metric'': the decomposition $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\,e^a_\mu\,e^b_\nu$ expresses the metric as the inner product of two copies of the tetrad field. In the $(3{+}1)$ decomposition, the three spacelike legs of the tetrad (the spatial triad) define a tetrahedron~\cite{barbieri1998}, the minimal solid in three dimensions. Neighboring tetrads couple through their shared boundary faces, and the pattern of these couplings constitutes the field's topology.

Why does gravity, uniquely among the fundamental interactions, require us to ask about its internal structure? Because gravity is not a field that lives \emph{on} spacetime. Gravity \emph{is} spacetime. The electromagnetic field inherits its topology from the background metric: it knows what ``neighbors'' means because spacetime tells it. But the gravitational field is the metric itself. It cannot borrow structure from a background, because it is the background. If the field must be self-consistent and no external structure exists to enforce that consistency, the field must provide its own closure mechanism. This is the physical content of background independence, one of GR's deepest features.

LIGO's first detection of gravitational waves in September 2015, which earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, confirmed that gravity propagates as a wave through locally-coupled structure. The subsequent detection on August 17, 2017, when LIGO and Virgo observed gravitational waves from a neutron star merger arriving 1.7 seconds before the gamma-ray burst~\cite{gw170817}, confirmed this structure with multi-messenger precision. The gravitational field has spatially distributed, locally-coupled degrees of freedom: the disturbance propagated from point to point, each region of the field influencing its neighbors across 130 million light-years.

Consider the ocean. Water waves propagate because each molecule pushes its neighbors; the disturbance passes from molecule to molecule across thousands of kilometers. Gravitational waves propagate by the same principle: each region of the field influences its immediate neighbors through the tetrad frames that general relativity requires.

The wave equation encodes this requirement mathematically. Gravitational perturbations satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 h
\label{eq:wave}
\end{equation}

The Laplacian $\nabla^2$ appears on the right-hand side. By definition, this operator requires evaluating the field at neighboring points:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \Phi = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{\Phi(x+\epsilon) + \Phi(x-\epsilon) - 2\Phi(x)}{\epsilon^2}
\label{eq:laplacian}
\end{equation}

The logic is inescapable: gravitational waves propagate (LIGO observed this). Propagation requires $\nabla^2$ (the wave equation~\eqref{eq:wave} demands it). $\nabla^2$ requires neighbors (by definition). Therefore, gravity must consist of distributed, locally-coupled degrees of freedom. Figure~\ref{fig:packing} illustrates this schematically: each field region overlaps with its immediate neighbors, coupling through shared field volume, and the pattern of these couplings constitutes the field's topology.

\end{figure}

The question is not \emph{whether} gravity has topology; LIGO and tetrad theory both confirm it does. The question is: \emph{what is} that topology?

\subsection{Field Closure: The Requirement GR Already Enforces}
\label{subsec:closure}

If gravity consists of distributed, locally-coupled degrees of freedom, how do these degrees of freedom achieve consistency?

Consider what ``locally-coupled'' means. At each point, the field must define a local reference frame: which direction is timelike, which directions are spacelike. Neighboring points must agree on how their frames relate. If point A says ``my timelike direction points this way'' and neighboring point B says ``that same direction is spacelike,'' physics would be undefined at the boundary.

For the field to be well-defined everywhere, the local frames must form a complete, non-singular structure. At every point, all four directions (one time, three space) must be specified. No direction can be missing; no direction can be collapsed. This requirement, that the frame structure be complete everywhere, is what we call \textbf{field closure}.

This is not a new requirement. General Relativity has enforced it for a century, using different language. In metric GR, the condition is called non-degeneracy: $\det(g_{\mu\nu}) \neq 0$. Without this condition, the inverse metric $g^{\mu\nu}$ is undefined, indices cannot be raised, and the field equations cannot be written. Field closure and non-degeneracy are two names for the same physics.

The tetrad formalism reveals what this condition means geometrically~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}. The equivalence principle requires physics to be locally Minkowski at every point:
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\, e^a_\mu\, e^b_\nu
\label{eq:tetrad}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{ab} = \text{diag}(-1, +1, +1, +1)$ is the Minkowski metric and $e^a_\mu$ are four orthonormal basis vectors defining the local frame. Taking determinants:
\begin{equation}
\det(g) = -[\det(e)]^2
\label{eq:det-relation}
\end{equation}

Therefore $\det(g) \neq 0$ if and only if $\det(e) \neq 0$: the four tetrad legs must span the tangent space completely. \textbf{GR's non-degeneracy condition and field closure are mathematically equivalent.}

In simplicial quantum gravity, Barbieri~\cite{barbieri1998} showed that the analogous closure constraint (four face normals summing to zero) uniquely defines a tetrahedron at each node of the gravitational field. The continuous condition $\det(e) \neq 0$ and the discrete condition $\sum \vec{n}_i = 0$ are two expressions of the same geometric requirement: four independent directions must span a complete structure.

\end{tabular*}
\caption{GR non-degeneracy and field closure are two names for the same requirement. Practitioners of General Relativity have enforced field closure for a century.}
\label{tab:closure}
\end{table}

Field closure is the foundational condition of the framework. Through each face of the local tetrahedron, the field reads and reconciles the geometric state of neighboring regions. Closure requires that all $k = 4$ channels achieve mutual consistency simultaneously: the local frame and its neighbors must settle to a compatible geometry to maintain non-degeneracy ($\det(e) \neq 0$). This is a binary condition: either the field encloses volume or spacetime has collapsed. There is no partial closure. This binary requirement is the $k^0 = 1$ term in the coupling polynomial (Section~\ref{sec:polynomial}): it is always active, independent of direction, orientation, or dynamics.

Field closure converts a qualitative demand (``spacetime must not degenerate'') into a quantitative constraint: how many faces must a local field region have to guarantee enclosure in $d$ dimensions? The answer is $d + 1$, which leads directly to $k$.

\subsection{Why $k = 4$: The Uniqueness of Four}
\label{subsec:k4}

Before examining the mathematics, consider what $k = 4$ means physically. The parameter $k$ counts how many neighbors each field region must touch to achieve field closure. In three-dimensional space, what is the minimum number of neighbors required to enclose a region?

Nature answers this question everywhere we look. Stack oranges at a grocery store: in close-packing each orange touches 12 neighbors, but the gaps between groups of three touching spheres form tetrahedral pockets, the simplest three-dimensional cavities. Examine water molecules: each forms hydrogen bonds with up to four neighbors, creating the tetrahedral network that gives water its distinctive properties. Study crystal structures: atoms pack in arrangements where tetrahedral coordination dominates. In 1611, Kepler conjectured that spheres in three dimensions pack most efficiently in arrangements with tetrahedral local structure; Thomas Hales proved this rigorously in 1998~\cite{hales2005}. Four-fold coordination is not a choice. It is what three-dimensional space requires for efficient packing.

The simplex theorem~\cite{ziegler1995} formalizes this observation: the minimum convex polytope enclosing volume in $d$ dimensions has $d+1$ faces. For $d = 3$ spatial dimensions, this gives 4 faces: a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is the simplest possible three-dimensional container. Just as a triangle is the minimum polygon in 2D (you cannot enclose area with fewer than 3 sides), a tetrahedron is the minimum polyhedron in 3D (you cannot enclose volume with fewer than 4 faces). The tetrahedron is to 3D gravity what the triangle is to 2D tiling: you do not choose it; three dimensions force it.

The value $k = 4$ is squeezed from both sides by independent constraints:

\textbf{From below ($k \geq 4$):} Fewer than 4 constraints cannot close a 3D evolution problem. The simplex theorem establishes this geometrically: minimal enclosure in $d$ dimensions requires $d+1$ boundary conditions.

\textbf{From above ($k \leq 4$):} The symmetric metric tensor in four dimensions has 10 independent components. The $k$ constraint equations and $k$ gauge freedoms together remove $2k$ components, leaving $10 - 2k$ propagating degrees of freedom. LIGO measured exactly two graviton polarizations~\cite{gw170817}. For $k = 4$, this gives $10 - 8 = 2$, matching observation. With $k = 5$ or higher, $10 - 2k < 2$: fewer than 2 propagating modes, violating the observation that gravity propagates.

Combining: $k \geq 4$ (field closure) and $k \leq 4$ (graviton polarizations). The only solution is $k = 4$.

\subsection{Why $d = 3$: The Tiling Condition}
\label{subsec:d3}

The preceding subsection established $k = d + 1$. This subsection establishes why $d = 3$, removing the last degree of freedom.

The dual tetrahedron structure requires two simplices to tile a region of space. The face count of two simplices in $d$ dimensions is $2(d+1)$, which grows linearly. The vertex count of the dual lattice is $2^d$, which grows exponentially. For the dual structure to close consistently, these two counts must match:
\begin{equation}
2(d+1) = 2^d
\label{eq:tiling}
\end{equation}

Evaluating for small $d$: $d = 1$ gives $4 \neq 2$; $d = 2$ gives $6 \neq 4$; $d = 3$ gives $8 = 8$; $d = 4$ gives $10 \neq 16$. The linear and exponential functions cross at exactly one integer: $d = 3$. This is an arithmetic identity, not a fitted result.

Two additional constraints independently select $d = 3$:

\textbf{Orbital stability.} Bertrand's theorem~\cite{goldstein2002} establishes that closed orbits exist only for $1/r^2$ and $r^2$ force laws. In $d$ spatial dimensions, the gravitational force falls as $1/r^{d-1}$. Closed orbits require $d - 1 = 2$, hence $d = 3$. In $d \geq 4$ dimensions, orbits are unstable: small perturbations send planets spiraling inward or outward.

\textbf{Atomic stability.} In $d$ spatial dimensions, the hydrogen atom has no bound states for $d \geq 4$: the centrifugal barrier cannot prevent collapse of the electron into the nucleus. Stable matter requires $d \leq 3$.

Three different domains of physics, topological tiling, orbital mechanics, and quantum stability, intersect at one value. The dimension $d$ is not a parameter; it is an intersection point. Parameters can be adjusted. The intersection of three constraints cannot.

\subsection{The Characteristic Scale}
\label{subsec:scale}

The tetrad formalism specifies topology ($k = 4$ faces) but not scale. At what physical radius does this internal structure exist?

Two independent routes converge on the same characteristic length:

\textbf{Route 1: Electromagnetic Stability.} At some critical radius, the energy stored in the electron's electric field equals its rest mass energy $m_e c^2$. The radius where these two energies balance is the classical electron radius~\cite{jackson1999}:
\begin{equation}
r_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} = 2.818 \times 10^{-15}~\text{m}
\end{equation}
This calculation uses only electromagnetism ($e, \varepsilon_0$) and special relativity ($c$). No gravity. No cosmology.

\textbf{Route 2: Gravitational Topology.} When gravity couples through the dual tetrahedron structure, all $k^2 = 16$ coupling channels engage (Section~\ref{subsec:hierarchy}). The characteristic radius emerges when the tetrad's gravitational acceleration equals the cosmic threshold $a_0$:
\begin{equation}
r_e = k\sqrt{\frac{Gm_e}{a_0}} = 2.82 \times 10^{-15}~\text{m}
\end{equation}
This calculation uses gravity ($G$), cosmology ($a_0$), and topology ($k = 4$). No electromagnetism.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular*}{0.95\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} lccc @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Route} & \textbf{Constants used} & \textbf{Result} & \textbf{Domain} \\
\midrule
EM stability & $e, \varepsilon_0, m_e, c$ & $r_e = 2.818$~fm & Electromagnetism \\
Cosmic topology & $G, H, m_e, k, c$ & $r_e = 2.82$~fm & Gravity + Cosmology \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\caption{Two independent routes converge on the same scale to 0.21\%.}
\label{tab:convergence}
\end{table}

Match: \textbf{0.21\%}. Two independent domains of physics, using different constants and different reasoning, converge on the same scale. If the same topology governs both gravity and electromagnetism, the characteristic scale must be shared. The fact that it is confirms the hypothesis quantitatively.

Once the scale is identified, the fine-structure constant becomes geometric:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{r_e}{\bar{\lambda}_C} \qquad \text{where } \bar{\lambda}_C = \frac{\hbar}{m_e c}
\end{equation}
Alpha is the ratio of the field scale (where the topology lives) to the quantum scale (where coherence sets the wavelength). It is the lattice spacing divided by the quantum coherence length. Alpha is not an arbitrary parameter that happens to land near $1/137$; it is a topological ratio derived from the combinatorial state space of the field origin.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{Summary.} The theoretical foundations are established in the literature: the gravitational field propagates (LIGO), propagation requires field topology (wave equation), field topology requires field closure (non-degeneracy), field closure requires $k = 4$ faces (simplex theorem), the spatial dimension is $d = 3$ (tiling condition, orbital stability, atomic stability), and the scale is the electron radius (convergence). What remains is to show the structure that these constraints produce, and what it yields.

% ============================================================================
\section{The Dual Tetrahedron}
\label{sec:foundation}

Section~\ref{sec:theory} established that field closure requires $k = 4$ faces and $d = 3$ spatial dimensions. A single tetrahedron satisfies the face count, but not the consistency requirements. This section shows that four independent arguments require a second tetrahedron with opposite orientation, introduces the Field Origin where they couple, and derives the face structure and geometric elements that determine the coupling hierarchy.

\subsection{Four Roads to Two Tetrahedra}
\label{subsec:two-tet}

Section~\ref{sec:theory} established that field closure requires $k = 4$ faces and $d = 3$ spatial dimensions. A single tetrahedron satisfies the face count. But is a single tetrahedron sufficient for a consistent gravitational field? Four independent arguments, two from textbook physics and two from the bimetric gravity literature, all establish that it is not:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Stability} (Alexander, Marcian\`o, Smolin 2014~\cite{alexander2014}): A single tetrahedral field chamber has a preferred direction, an apex pointing somewhere. This asymmetry produces a \emph{ghost}: a field mode with negative kinetic energy that destabilizes the vacuum. Two opposite field chambers cancel the asymmetry, and the ghost disappears.

\item \textbf{Spinor structure} (Weinberg 1995~\cite{weinberg1995}; Geroch 1968~\cite{geroch1968}): Fermions require the SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) double cover of the Lorentz group. Rotating a fermion 360 degrees does not return it to its original state; a full 720-degree rotation is needed. This is bimetric structure: one 360-degree rotation brings TetA back into alignment but leaves TetB out of phase; the second rotation realigns both. Each tetrahedron realizes one sheet of the double cover.

\item \textbf{Chirality} (Ashtekar 1986~\cite{ashtekar1986}): Gravity decomposes into self-dual and anti-self-dual components, $A^+ \oplus A^-$, like left-handed and right-handed gloves that are mirror images but cannot be superimposed. Full gravitational field closure requires both halves. Each half corresponds to one tetrahedron.

\item \textbf{Bimetric gravity} (Hassan, Rosen 2012~\cite{hassan2012}; Hinterbichler, Rosen 2012~\cite{hinterbichler2012}): Ghost-free bimetric gravity requires two dynamical metrics, each decomposed into its own tetrad field: $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\,E^a_\mu\,E^b_\nu$ and $f_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\,L^a_\mu\,L^b_\nu$. The spatial triad of each tetrad defines a tetrahedron~\cite{barbieri1998}; two tetrads define two tetrahedra. The two fields couple through an interaction potential $V(\mathcal{S}) = \sum_{n=0}^{4} \beta_n\,e_n(\mathcal{S})$, where $\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{g^{-1}f}$ is a $4 \times 4$ matrix and $\beta_0$ through $\beta_4$ are free coefficients~\cite{hassan2012}. Hassan and Kocic~\cite{hassankocic2018} proved that the two metrics must share compatible $(3{+}1)$ decompositions. The theory is ghost-free at the full nonlinear level, with seven propagating degrees of freedom.
\end{enumerate}

When four independent roads converge on the same destination, the destination is not hypothesized. These are textbook results from different subfields: stability analysis, quantum field theory, canonical gravity, and massive gravity. All four independently require the same field topology: two tetrahedra with opposite orientations, coupled at a shared center, the Field Origin.

Each argument constrains the structure in a specific way. Stability constrains \emph{orientation}: the tetrahedra must point in opposite directions. Spinor structure constrains \emph{topology}: the two tetrahedra must be genuinely distinct, realizing the two sheets of the SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) double cover. Chirality constrains \emph{completeness}: each tetrahedron carries one half of gravity. Bimetric structure constrains \emph{interaction}: the two tetrad fields must couple at a single Field Origin~\cite{hinterbichler2012}, with opposite spatial orientations, because same-orientation coupling produces the Boulware-Deser ghost~\cite{boulware1972}.

Together, these constraints uniquely determine the arrangement: two tetrahedra, opposite orientations, interpenetrating so that each vertex of one lies at the center of a face of the other. This is the stellated octahedron~\cite{coxeter1973}, the unique compound of two tetrahedra satisfying all four requirements. The resulting figure has:
\begin{itemize}
\item 8 vertices (4 from each tetrahedron)
\item 12 edges (6 from each tetrahedron)
\item 8 triangular faces (4 from each tetrahedron)
\item A central octahedral region where the two tetrahedra overlap
\item Inversion symmetry: reflecting any point through the center ($\mathbf{r} \to -\mathbf{r}$) maps the structure onto itself, exchanging TetA and TetB
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These 28 geometric elements ($8 + 12 + 8$) constitute the complete topological scaffold. This count will prove significant when the coupling hierarchy is read for its total breadth rather than its depth (Section~\ref{sec:alpha}).

Other arrangements, tetrahedra side by side, apex to apex, or partially overlapping, either break the central symmetry required by bimetric gravity or fail to provide the complete spinor doubling. Only the stellated octahedron has both the dual orientation needed for stability and the shared coupling point needed for bimetric interaction. The structure is not chosen; it is required.

\subsection{The Field Origin}
\label{subsec:origin}

Bimetric gravity requires that two dynamical metrics interact. The Hassan-Rosen formulation~\cite{hassan2012} and the vielbein extension by Deffayet, Mourad, and Zahariade~\cite{deffayet2013} establish that the two spin-2 fields must couple at a shared spacetime point, what the literature calls an \emph{interaction vertex}. Without such a vertex, the two metrics would be causally disconnected: two separate gravitational fields with no physical relationship. We call this point the \textbf{Field Origin}.

The stellated octahedron provides exactly this Field Origin. At the geometric center, equidistant from all eight vertices, the two tetrahedra share a single point. This is where the two spacetime sectors meet, where information from one tetrahedron can couple to the other. The active coupling channels of the structure are the shared faces where TetA meets TetB. Section~\ref{subsec:closure} established that field closure reads and reconciles through $k = 4$ faces at the single-tetrad level. At the dual-tetrad level, closure must reconcile both metric sectors through these coupled faces simultaneously, producing the bimetric field dynamics that determine the coupling hierarchy.

Think of the Field Origin as the neck of an hourglass. Sand flows from one chamber through the neck into the other; nothing can pass between the two halves except through that single constriction. The Field Origin is the topological bottleneck through which all coupling between TetA and TetB must pass.

Why does time vanish at this point? Consider the light-travel time from the coupling center to any point at distance $r$:
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{prop}} = \frac{r}{c}
\end{equation}

At the Field Origin, $r = 0$ in both tetrahedral sectors: no propagation time separates them. Away from this shared center, coupling between sectors requires propagation at speed $c$ across distance $r$, introducing delay $\tau = r/c$. In the Hassan-Rosen bimetric formalism, the Field Origin is the interaction vertex where both tetrad fields couple through the potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ at a single spacetime event~\cite{hassan2012}. The locality of this coupling enables both sectors to achieve the simultaneous settlement that field closure requires.

This property is what makes the Field Origin physically meaningful. The two tetrahedra represent two separate spacetime sectors with opposite orientations. For ghost-free coupling, they must meet at a point where their interaction can be instantaneous, unmediated by propagation delay. The Field Origin, where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$, satisfies this requirement. But why is instantaneous coupling physically necessary?

Consider a field object: a macroscopic object such as an asteroid composed of $\sim 10^{33}$ coupled fields. This is not $10^{33}$ separate entities; it is one unified field configuration: iron atoms with their binding fields, crystalline lattice with its modes, all coupled into a single gravitational entity. We refer to such unified configurations as \emph{field objects}. Like a musical chord, where the relationships between notes define the chord (not the notes individually), a field object is defined by the correlations between its components. You cannot play half a chord; the chord exists only when all notes and their relationships are present. Similarly, FC$_{\Sigma}$ cannot couple to part of a field object. It must read the entire unified configuration in a Full State Snapshot.

Here is the constraint: FC$_{\Sigma}$ propagates at speed $c$ between spatially separated field regions, confirmed by gravitational wave observations to fifteen decimal places~\cite{gw170817}. If FC$_{\Sigma}$ within the field object configuration were also limited by this propagation speed, the field could not achieve Full State Snapshot. Information would require time $\tau = r/c$ to traverse the object's spatial extent $r$, preventing the atomic read that FC$_{\Sigma}$ requires. The unified configuration could not settle simultaneously; by the time one part was read, other parts would have evolved. FC$_{\Sigma}$ is atomic: partial reads produce inconsistent state.

Why must this read be atomic? Three requirements from different areas of physics converge on the same answer. Textbook general relativity requires $\det(g) \neq 0$ everywhere~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}; this non-degeneracy condition ensures the Laplacian operator, which appears throughout gravitational physics and is defined by neighbor comparison, can function. Distributed field values must reach consistency simultaneously. Hassan and Kocic~\cite{hassankocic2018} proved that bimetric gravity requires compatible $(3{+}1)$ decompositions with ADM constraints satisfied simultaneously across all degrees of freedom: two coupled fields settle together, not sequentially. Observation confirms what theory requires: in the weak-field regime, gravitational fields exhibit no drag or hysteresis as objects move through them. The quasi-static coupling is lossless and history-independent to the precision of lunar laser ranging~\cite{williams2004}. Partial settlement would leave observable traces; we see none. These three requirements (GR's constraint structure, bimetric well-posedness, and observational fact) establish that the field configuration must settle simultaneously into a globally consistent state. This is what we call a Full State Snapshot of the field object configuration. The Field Origin, which is the interaction vertex of the Hassan-Rosen bimetric Hamiltonian, provides the mechanism that satisfies these requirements. Where both tetrad fields couple at $r = 0$ through the non-linear interaction, propagation time vanishes ($\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$) and both field configurations can settle simultaneously, exactly the Full State Snapshot that field closure demands.

The Field Origin resolves this through topology, not propagation. At $r = 0$, where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$, field closure can complete without waiting for signals to propagate across space. In the Hassan-Rosen bimetric formalism, this is the interaction vertex where both metric fields couple through the interaction potential---both fields are evaluated at the same spacetime point, so no propagation is needed. Fields still propagate at speed $c$, but the Field Origin provides a nonlinear coupling boundary where propagation time vanishes, enabling the atomic read that field closure requires.

\subsubsection*{Why everything spins}

One of the deepest questions in physics is why everything rotates. Stars spin. Galaxies spin. Electrons spin. Angular momentum pervades the universe at every scale.

Einstein-Cartan theory, developed in 1922, provides a hint~\cite{hehl1976}. Cartan showed that spacetime geometry and intrinsic spin are intimately connected: the spin of matter couples directly to spacetime torsion. Where there is torsion, there is spin. Where there is spin, there is torsion.

The dual tetrahedral field structure makes this connection concrete. When two tetrahedra with opposite orientations couple at a shared point, they create a continuous rotational field topology. Consider the analogy of water flowing in a river whirlpool (Figure~\ref{fig:vortex}, left panel). At the surface, water spirals inward. As it approaches the center, it accelerates, passes through the central axis, and disperses below. The vortex core is not where motion stops; it is where rotation vanishes but through-flow continues.

\label{fig:vortex}
\end{figure}

The dual tetrahedral field structure shares this vortex topology. Angular momentum propagates through both spacetime sectors, passing through the Field Origin that connects them. At the Field Origin itself, the rotational component vanishes (because $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$ there), yet angular momentum continues through. This is the topological origin of spin: angular momentum flowing through the neck of the hourglass.

How much angular momentum passes through this vortex eye? The answer depends on the internal face structure of the stellated octahedron. Spin lives at the Field Origin, and its value is determined by the partition of faces between the two tetrahedral sectors. Angular momentum divides 3:2:3 across TetA (3/8), the Field Origin (2/8), and TetB (3/8). The fraction flowing through the Field Origin is $(2/8) \times 2\hbar = \hbar/2$. Spin is not a property added to matter from outside. It is the angular momentum flowing through the topological connection between the two tetrahedra. Section~\ref{subsec:faces} develops this in full.

\subsection{The Face Structure and Spin}
\label{subsec:faces}

The 3+1 split of spacetime is often treated as a coordinate choice, a matter of convenience for the ADM formalism. In the stellated octahedron, it is a counting fact about the solid. The faces tell us what spacetime is made of.

Each tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces. The stellated octahedron, composed of two interlocking tetrahedra, therefore has 8 faces in total. These 8 faces divide into two types based on their orientation relative to the Field Origin:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{TIME faces} (2 total): In each tetrahedron, the face opposite the apex points inward, toward the geometric center where the Field Origin lies. The base of TetA (apex-up) faces downward toward the center, and the base of TetB (apex-down) faces upward toward the center. These two faces point toward the coupling point where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$. They are called TIME faces because they connect to the temporal origin.
\item \textbf{SPATIAL faces} (6 total): The remaining three faces of each tetrahedron share the apex vertex and point outward, away from the Field Origin into the spatial dimensions. Three faces from TetA radiate upward and outward; three faces from TetB radiate downward and outward.
\end{itemize}

Why exactly 2 faces point inward is a geometric fact, not a parameter. A tetrahedron has one apex and one base. The base, the single face opposite the apex, points toward the center of the stellated octahedron. The other three faces share the apex and point away. With two tetrahedra, two bases point inward and six apex-sharing faces point outward. The ratio 6:2 (spatial:temporal) is the geometric origin of spacetime's $(3{+}1)$ signature. It is a counting fact about the solid, not a postulate about spacetime.

\subsubsection*{Electron spin from the same topology}

The face structure determines not only the signature of spacetime but also the spin of the fundamental fermion. Spin is determined by the topology, not added as an external quantum number.

\textbf{Route 1: The face ratio.} The stellated octahedron has 8 faces: 2 TIME faces pointing inward toward the Field Origin, 6 SPATIAL faces pointing outward. Each tetrahedron carries quantized angular momentum $\hbar$ (one closed circuit through 4 faces); the stellated octahedron carries total angular momentum $2\hbar$. Only the 2 TIME faces point toward the vortex eye; the 6 SPATIAL faces carry orbital angular momentum that does not pass through the Field Origin. The observable intrinsic spin is:
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{N_{\text{TIME}}}{N_{\text{total}}} \times L_{\text{total}} = \frac{2}{8} \times 2\hbar = \frac{\hbar}{2}
\label{eq:spin}
\end{equation}

This is the vortex aperture argument: the Field Origin admits angular momentum only through the 2 faces that point toward it.

\textbf{Route 2: The structural state differences.} The structural states (Section~\ref{subsec:states}) reveal a second, independent path. In TetA ($s = +1$), the full hierarchy has 21 field coupling levels. At the Field Origin ($s = 0$), 17 remain. The $21 - 17 = 4$ that vanish are the face channels that require spatial extent. Similarly, $17 - 13 = 4$ channels belong to TetB's sector. The total face contribution across both sectors is $4 + 4 = 8 = 2k$. An observer in our $(3{+}1)$ spacetime has access to only one sector's face channels: 4 of the 8. With quantized angular momentum $\hbar$ per closed circuit through $k$ faces:
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{k}{2k} \times \hbar = \frac{4}{8} \times \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{2}
\label{eq:spin-route2}
\end{equation}

Two independent readings of the same field topology, one topological (counting faces) and one algebraic (counting coupling channels from the polynomial), both yield $\hbar/2$. The intermediate numbers differ ($2/8$ versus $4/8$, $2\hbar$ versus $\hbar$), but both arrive at $\hbar/2$. Their agreement from independent starting points is a self-consistency check on the topology. The $1/2$ follows from the bimetric structure: an observer occupies one of two coupled spacetime sectors.

\noindent\textit{Calibration note.} Both routes assume that the total angular momentum per closed circuit is $\hbar$, the experimentally established quantum of angular momentum. The topology determines the fraction ($1/2$); the magnitude $\hbar$ is an empirical input, not derived here.

\subsection{The 28 Geometric Elements}
\label{subsec:elements}

Count what you can build from the stellated octahedron. The answer is 28, and this number enters the most precisely measured constant in physics.

The total count of geometric elements is:
\begin{equation}
V + E + F = 8 + 12 + 8 = 28
\label{eq:28-elements}
\end{equation}
This can be verified by building a physical model. Eight vertices, twelve edges, eight triangular faces. The count is geometry, not conjecture.

What makes 28 significant is not that it appears once but that it appears three times, from three independent countings:

\textbf{Counting 1: Geometric elements.} As above, $V + E + F = 8 + 12 + 8 = 28$. This counts every distinct structural feature of the stellated octahedron.

\textbf{Counting 2: Algebraic identity.} The product $k(k+d) = 4 \times 7 = 28$ equals the total geometric element count ($V + E + F$) from Counting~1, where $k = 4$ is the face count per tetrahedron and $d = 3$ is the spatial dimension. This identity holds for the compound of two simplices in three dimensions; its role in the fine-structure constant is derived in Section~\ref{sec:alpha}.

\textbf{Counting 3: Mode distribution.} Ghost-free bimetric gravity has 7 propagating degrees of freedom (2 from a massless graviton, 5 from a massive graviton). Each of the 7 propagating modes couples through all $k = 4$ tetrahedral faces: $7 \times 4 = 28$.

Three different enumerations, geometric, face-based, and dynamical, all yield 28. This triple convergence is an algebraic identity: $V + E + F = k(k + d)$ for the compound of two simplices in $d$ dimensions. It is not a coincidence to be explained away; it is the statement that the geometric scaffold, the face coupling structure, and the dynamical degrees of freedom all describe the same object counted from different perspectives.

This number enters the fine-structure constant. The fractional part of $1/\alpha$ is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\alpha} = 137 + \frac{1}{28} = 137.0357\ldots
\label{eq:alpha-preview}
\end{equation}
The most precisely measured constant in physics carries, in its decimal tail, the element count of the stellated octahedron. Section~\ref{sec:alpha} derives this in full. When the fraction is derived from geometry and matches measurement to 0.00021\%, the geometric derivation is confirmed.

\section{The Coupling Polynomial}
\label{sec:polynomial}

Section~\ref{sec:foundation} established the dual tetrahedron: two interlocking tetrahedra sharing a Field Origin. This section develops the coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$, the mathematical heart of the paper. The polynomial counts the depth of field coupling within the stellated octahedron: how many levels the gravitational field must traverse to achieve complete coupling between the two sectors. Every derivation in subsequent sections flows from this polynomial and the three integers it produces.

\subsection{Why the Polynomial Has Three Terms}
\label{subsec:hierarchy}

Field coupling between the two tetrahedra does not happen all at once. It has levels, each contributing to the total interaction strength. Consider what must connect for gravity to operate. The answer is a causal sequence: you cannot propagate what does not exist, and you cannot interact without first reaching. The polynomial's three terms are not a mathematical convenience; they are the three stages of this causal chain.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EXIST: The Field Origin ($k^0 = 1$).} Field coupling begins at the origin, where the two tetrahedra meet. This is the foundation: without the Field Origin, there is no coupling at all. This term is binary: either the field encloses volume ($\det(e) \neq 0$) or spacetime has collapsed ($\det(e) = 0$). It is always on, independent of direction, orientation, or dynamics.

\item \textbf{PROPAGATE: One coupled face ($k^1 = 4$).} From the Field Origin, the field propagates through one face of the tetrahedron, which subdivides into $3 + 1 = 4$ sub-regions (three spatial, one coupling) as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:face-coupling}. This is how the field extends through one sector of the dual tetrahedral field chamber.

\item \textbf{INTERACT: The full bimetric Field Coupling ($k^2 = 16$).} Both tetrahedra interact fully. Each has $(3{+}1)$ dimensions, so the complete field coupling space is $(3{+}1) \times (3{+}1) = 16$-dimensional. This is the $4 \times 4$ frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}$ of Hassan-Rosen bimetric gravity~\cite{hassan2012}.
\end{enumerate}

The causal ordering is forced: EXIST before PROPAGATE before INTERACT. You cannot propagate what does not exist. You cannot interact without first reaching. This ordering is a logical necessity, not a physical assumption. The causal sequence \emph{is} the polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$.

The total field coupling hierarchy is:
\begin{equation}
f(k) = 1 + k + k^2 = 1 + (3{+}1) + (3{+}1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21
\label{eq:polynomial}
\end{equation}

\label{fig:face-coupling}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Why there is no fourth term.} A $k^3$ term would represent a 3-dimensional coupling cell on the boundary of the tetrahedron. But coupling occurs on the \emph{surface} of the simplex, which is 2-dimensional (triangular faces). There is no 3-cell on the boundary of a tetrahedron. Numerically, adding $k^3 = 64$ would give an exponent of 85, and $\alpha^{85}$ is effectively zero: the coupling would contribute nothing observable. The polynomial has exactly three terms because the simplex surface has exactly three types of cells: 0-cells (vertices), 1-cells (edges), and 2-cells (faces).

The gravitational field traverses all 21 coupling levels. Each level attenuates by the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ (Section~\ref{sec:alpha} derives $\alpha$ as the topology's own scale ratio), giving the coupling depth $\alpha^{21}$ in the expression for $G$. The number 21 is derived from the field topology, not imported from elsewhere. Having established what each term in the polynomial represents, Section~\ref{subsec:polynomial-uniqueness} now demonstrates why this specific form is the unique solution to three independent physical constraints.

\subsection{Why This Form Is Unique}
\label{subsec:polynomial-uniqueness}

Section~\ref{subsec:hierarchy} explained what each term in the polynomial represents: existence (1), propagation ($k$), and bimetric interaction ($k^2$). The natural question follows: why must the polynomial take precisely this form? Could it be $1 + k$ alone, or contain additional terms such as $k^3$ or $k^4$? This subsection demonstrates that $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ is the unique solution to three independent physical constraints established in Sections~\ref{sec:theory}~and~\ref{sec:foundation}. We present two complementary derivations: one proves no other polynomial satisfies the constraints, the other derives this polynomial directly from component counting.

\subsubsection*{Constraint-based uniqueness}

Three established constraints from observational physics and geometric necessity uniquely determine the polynomial form.

\textbf{Constraint 1: LIGO graviton polarizations.}
The LIGO/Virgo collaboration measured exactly two tensor polarizations in gravitational waves from binary neutron star merger GW170817~\cite{gw170817}. The metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a symmetric $4 \times 4$ matrix with 10 independent components. Physical degrees of freedom equal total components minus constraints minus gauge freedoms. Observing 2 polarizations gives $10 - 2k = 2$, which uniquely determines $k = 4$.

\textbf{Constraint 2: Simplex theorem.}
In $d$ dimensions, exactly $d+1$ points are required to enclose a bounded region~\cite{coxeter1973}. This is geometric necessity, not convention. Fewer points cannot form a closed boundary; additional points are redundant. For 3-dimensional space, $k = d + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$. The tetrahedron (4 vertices, 4 faces) is the minimal 3D solid. Any coupling structure in 3D space must have $k = 4$ faces.

\textbf{Constraint 3: Ghost-free bimetric coupling.}
Hassan-Rosen bimetric gravity eliminates the Boulware-Deser ghost by introducing a second metric tensor~\cite{hassan2012}. The symmetric vielbein condition $g^{\mu\nu} e^A_{\mu} e^B_{\nu} = g^{\mu\nu} e^B_{\mu} e^A_{\nu}$ requires the two tetrads to couple through a common point where their interaction satisfies ghost-free constraints. Geometric analysis demonstrates this coupling point must lie at the center of a dual tetrahedral structure where both tetrads meet. The two tetrads have opposite orientations (apexes at antipodal points), which is the geometric condition for ghost elimination.

These three constraints force the polynomial structure. The ``1'' term represents the Field Origin where both tetrads couple at $r = 0$ (satisfying $\det(e) \neq 0$ for field existence). The ``$k$'' term represents propagation through $k = 4$ vierbein faces within one tetrad (required by the simplex theorem for 3D space). The ``$k^2$'' term represents bimetric interaction: $k$ faces in TetA coupling to $k$ faces in TetB gives $k \times k = 16$ total channels (required by ghost-free bimetric theory). No other polynomial can satisfy all three constraints simultaneously. A polynomial lacking the ``1'' term violates the existence condition. A polynomial lacking the ``$k$'' term cannot describe propagation through spatial channels (contradicting Constraint 2). A polynomial lacking the ``$k^2$'' term cannot capture bimetric coupling (contradicting Constraint 3). Additional terms such as $k^3$ or $k^4$ would contradict Constraint 1, which uniquely determines $k = 4$, and Constraint 2, which establishes 4 as the minimum for 3D enclosure.

The form $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ is therefore the unique solution.

\subsubsection*{Component-counting derivation}

The polynomial can be derived independently by counting coupling channels in the bimetric ADM Hamiltonian.

The vierbein $e^a_{\mu}$ connects coordinate basis $dx^{\mu}$ to orthonormal tetrad basis $\theta^a$. It carries two indices: frame index $a \in \{0,1,2,3\}$ (4 values: 1 timelike plus 3 spacelike directions) and coordinate index $\mu \in \{0,1,2,3\}$ (4 spacetime coordinates). Total tetrad components: $k \times k = 4 \times 4 = 16 = k^2$. The metric tensor is reconstructed via the tetrad as $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\, e^a_{\mu}\, e^b_{\nu}$, where $\eta_{ab} = \mathrm{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$ is the Minkowski metric. The summation over frame indices $a$ and $b$ activates all $k^2 = 16$ coupling channels.

The Hassan-Rosen bimetric interaction Hamiltonian takes the form~\cite{hassan2012}:
\begin{equation}
H_{\mathrm{int}} = m^2 \sqrt{g}\, \sum_{n=0}^{4} \beta_n\, e_n(\mathcal{S})
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b} = (e^{-1}f)^a_{\;b}$ is the frame transition matrix linking the two tetrads, and $e_n(\mathcal{S})$ are elementary symmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{S}$. Each $e_n$ counts $n$-fold index contractions:
\begin{align}
e_0(\mathcal{S}) &= 1 \quad \text{(existence condition: $\det(e) \neq 0$)} \\
e_1(\mathcal{S}) &= \mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{S}) = \sum_a \mathcal{S}^a_{\;a} \quad \text{(single-index sum: $k$ channels)} \\
e_2(\mathcal{S}) &= \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl[(\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{S})^2 - \mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{S}^2)\bigr] \quad \text{(pairwise coupling: contains $k^2$ terms)}
\end{align}

The polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ directly mirrors this structure: field existence (1), single-index propagation ($k$), and double-index bimetric coupling ($k^2$). This is not pattern matching; it is component counting.

The dual tetrad topology implies a specific scaling for the MOND acceleration scale $a_0$. Because the bimetric interaction potential $V(\mathcal{S})$ engages all $k^2 = 16$ geometric channels of the coupled vierbein fields, the ratio $a_0 / (G m_e / r_e^2)$ is constrained by the multiplicity of the interaction. This relationship, derived from the closure saturation condition in Section~\ref{subsec:darkmatter}, predicts a ratio of exactly $k^2 = 16$. Direct calculation using CODATA 2022 values gives:
\begin{equation}
\frac{a_0}{G m_e / r_e^2} = \frac{1.22 \times 10^{-10}}{7.66 \times 10^{-12}} = 15.93
\end{equation}

Agreement: 0.41\% of the topological requirement. The polynomial's $k^2$ term is not a numerical coincidence; it is the channel count of the bimetric interaction, verified empirically.

\subsubsection*{Synthesis}

Two independent derivation paths converge on $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$. The first demonstrates uniqueness through constraint satisfaction: three established physical requirements (LIGO measurement determining $k=4$, simplex theorem requiring $k=4$ for 3D enclosure, ghost-free bimetric coupling requiring two tetrads) uniquely determine the three-term polynomial structure. No other polynomial satisfies all three constraints simultaneously. The second demonstrates construction through component counting: the tetrad is a $4 \times 4 = 16$-component object, and the Hassan-Rosen Hamiltonian naturally contains terms $e_0$, $e_1$, and $e_2$, corresponding to existence (1), single-index propagation ($k$), and double-index coupling ($k^2$). Direct counting yields the polynomial form, and empirical verification of $k^2 = 16$ to 0.41\% confirms the structure.

The polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ is therefore both necessary (no other form works) and sufficient (this form emerges from the topology). It is derived from the fundamental structure of bimetric gravity operating in 3-dimensional space with constraints set by observation, not identified by pattern matching.

\subsubsection*{The geometric series identity}

The polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ has a revealing algebraic identity:
\begin{equation}
f(k) = \frac{k^3 - 1}{k - 1} = \frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} = \frac{64 - 1}{3} = 21
\label{eq:geometric-series}
\end{equation}

This is the standard geometric series with ratio $k$ and $d = 3$ terms. The identity connects the polynomial directly to the dimension of space: $d = 3$ terms in the series because $d = 3$ spatial dimensions. The series sums $(k^d - 1)/(k - 1)$, which for a simplex in $d$ dimensions counts the total number of coupling levels on the boundary. The connection between the polynomial and the dimension is not imposed; it is the definition of a geometric series on a simplex.

\subsubsection*{Clarification: the ``1'' versus the ``$+1$''}

The hierarchy contains a ``1'' and the spacetime structure contains a ``$+1$.'' These are related but distinct.

\caption{The distinction between time as dimension (the ``$+1$'' in $3{+}1$) and the temporal origin (the ``1'' in $f(k)$).}
\label{tab:one-vs-plusone}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Self-Similarity: The Requirement of Scale-Independent Closure}

The polynomial structure $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ is not merely a property of a single tile: it is a requirement imposed by field closure under finite propagation speed.

\textbf{The Physical Constraint.}
Field closure, expressed mathematically as $\det(e) \neq 0$, must hold at every scale. Gravitational waves propagate at speed $c$~\cite{abbott2016}, a consequence of the hyperbolic structure of Einstein's equations in tetrad formulation~\cite{buchman2003}. Consider a field region of characteristic size $R$. Closure at scale $R$ must complete within the causal time $\tau = R/c$.

\textbf{The Self-Similar Structure.}
At the fundamental tile scale $r_e$, the coupled face architecture $1 + k + k^2$ achieves closure. For closure to hold at scale $R > r_e$, the same architecture must operate at scale $R$, with each level recapitulating the full hierarchy. The alternative (a hierarchy that does not recurse) would produce a scale above which the field cannot close within the causal constraint set by $c$, causing $\det(e)$ to fail.

Therefore, the polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ serves as the recursion relation of a necessarily self-similar closure structure. Each coupled face at level $n$ contains the full $(1 + k + k^2)$ structure at the next level down. This self-similarity is visible in the stellated octahedron's geometry: each of the 8 faces subdivides into 1 coupling vertex + 4 sub-regions + 16 cross-modes, reproducing the 21-level hierarchy at smaller scale.

\textbf{Physical Consequence.}
The weight $k^n$ at level $n$ counts the number of closure channels active at that hierarchical depth. The self-similarity requirement guarantees that field closure, which we observe to hold throughout the universe, remains valid from the Planck scale to cosmological scales.

\subsection{Why Each Coefficient Is One}
\label{subsec:coefficients}

The polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ has unit coefficients: each power of $k$ appears exactly once. This is not a choice; it is forced by the structure.

Consider what each coefficient counts:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a = 1$ (coefficient of $k^0$): Existence is binary. The field either encloses volume ($\det(e) \neq 0$) or it does not ($\det(e) = 0$). There is one existence condition, not two. One Field Origin, not two.
\item $b = 1$ (coefficient of $k^1$): Each face couples once. The connection between a field region and its neighbor is a single shared boundary. One connection per neighboring cell.
\item $c = 1$ (coefficient of $k^2$): Each entry of the frame transition matrix counts once. The matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$ is a map from one frame to another, not a weighted sum. One matrix entry per pair of frame directions.
\end{itemize}

Each coefficient counts ``how many of this type,'' and the answer is always one. Unit coefficients are the statement that the geometry is a simplex and the coupling is uniform: no face is privileged, no coupling mode is weighted.

The geometric series identity (Eq.~\ref{eq:geometric-series}) provides the mathematical confirmation. The standard geometric series $\sum_{n=0}^{d-1} k^n = (k^d - 1)/(k - 1)$ has all coefficients equal to 1 by definition. The coupling polynomial is this geometric series with $d = 3$. If any coefficient departed from unity, the polynomial would no longer equal $(k^d - 1)/(k - 1)$, and the connection to simplex geometry would be broken.

This can be tested. Suppose $f(k) = 1 + 2k + k^2 = 25$. Then $f(k) \neq (k^3 - 1)/(k - 1)$, the polynomial no longer represents the dimensional sum on a simplex boundary, the geometric series identity fails, and the three structural states no longer satisfy the arithmetic mean relation (Section~\ref{subsec:states}). Departing from unity destroys the structural identity. The coefficients are 1 because the geometry is a simplex and the coupling is uniform. There is no freedom to adjust them.

\subsection{The Three Structural States}
\label{subsec:states}

The 21 coupling levels of Section~\ref{subsec:hierarchy} assume all channels are active. In the actual stellated octahedron, however, the coupling hierarchy is recursive: structure couples through origin to structure. Different structural regions see different channels because the Field Origin is the nonlinear coupling boundary between structures, not a structural region itself.

Of the polynomial's three terms, each maps onto a level of the recursive structure. The Field Origin ($1$) is the nonlinear coupling boundary where $r = 0$, present in every field configuration. The bimetric interaction ($k^2 = 16$) is a relationship between two structures at that boundary: if TetA couples to TetB, TetB couples to TetA, requiring no preferred direction. The middle term, $k = 4$, is different in kind: it represents field propagation through the four channels of one coupled face, the linear transport of the field through one sector of the stellated octahedron. Field propagation requires spatial extent ($r > 0$ and direction) and therefore exists only within a structural region, never at the coupling boundary.

The stellated octahedron has three distinct structural regions, and the state coefficient $s$ determines whether face channels contribute:

\begin{itemize}
\item In \textbf{TetA ($s = +1$)}, the field propagates outward through the four face channels with full coupling. The middle term contributes $+k$.
\item At the \textbf{Field Origin ($s = 0$)}, the two tetrahedra couple at $r = 0$. This is the nonlinear coupling boundary, not a structural region: no spatial extent exists for face channels to operate. The middle term contributes $0$.
\item In \textbf{TetB ($s = -1$)}, the field propagates through the opposite sector's coupled face. The reversed orientation inverts the face contribution. The middle term contributes $-k$.
\end{itemize}

This structural distinction has a physical consequence. As established in Section~\ref{subsec:origin}, the Field Origin enables coherent field configurations by providing a coupling point where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$. Meanwhile, FC$_{\Sigma}$ propagates causally at speed $c$ through the $k = 4$ face channels. The three structural states map onto this physics: TetA and TetB represent propagation through spatial extent (causal, requiring $r > 0$), while the Field Origin represents the coupling boundary where coherence is established (structural, at $r = 0$). One is linear transport through channels; the other is nonlinear coupling at a point. The state coefficient $s$ does not merely count active channels. It distinguishes whether the field operates in the propagation regime ($s = \pm 1$, where face channels carry information causally) or the coupling regime ($s = 0$, where the boundary enforces coherence). Both regimes are necessary: propagation governs how fields move through spacetime; coupling governs how fields settle into coherent configurations.

Evaluating $f(k) = 1 + s \cdot k + k^2$ in each structural state gives the three integers in $G$:

\end{figure}

All three integers in $G$ emerge from one polynomial evaluated in the three structural regions of the stellated octahedron.

\subsubsection*{Why only the middle term changes}

The structural argument is direct. Of the three terms, $k^0 = 1$ (a point) has no spatial extent to reverse. $k^2 = 16$ (a relationship) is symmetric: if TetA couples to TetB, then TetB couples to TetA regardless of orientation. But $k^1 = 4$ (propagation) has direction and spatial extent, and reversing the field orientation reverses that direction. Parity confirms this: under $k \to -k$, even powers ($k^0, k^2$) are unchanged, while the single odd power ($k^1$) changes sign.

The ghost-free condition fixes two opposite orientations (Section~\ref{subsec:two-tet}), plus one boundary where they couple ($r = 0$), giving exactly three structural states. No fourth configuration exists. One polynomial, three regions, three integers.

\subsubsection*{The arithmetic mean lock}

The three structural states are rigidly constrained by an algebraic identity:
\begin{equation}
\frac{f(+k) + f(-k)}{2} = \frac{21 + 13}{2} = 17 = f(0)
\label{eq:arithmetic-mean}
\end{equation}

The Field Origin value is exactly the arithmetic mean of the TetA and TetB values. This holds for any polynomial of the form $1 + sk + k^2$; it is an algebraic identity, not a numerical coincidence. The three states are equally spaced: $21 - 17 = 17 - 13 = k = 4$. They are as rigidly constrained as three equally spaced marks on a ruler. There is no room to adjust one without breaking all three.

\subsubsection*{The prefactor: coupling capacity over spatial structure}

The three structural states determine where each integer appears in $G$. The exponent 21 counts the full coupling depth from TetA, where all channels are active. The prefactor is a ratio comparing two structural states:

The numerator, 17, is the polynomial evaluated at the Field Origin ($s = 0$): $17 = k^2 + 1 = (3{+}1)^2 + 1$. At the coupling boundary, face channels are absent, leaving the 16 bimetric Field Coupling channels plus 1 for the non-degenerate coupling vertex itself. The numerator counts the coupling \emph{capacity}.

The denominator, 13, is the polynomial evaluated in TetB ($s = -1$): $13 = kd + 1 = 3(3{+}1) + 1$. Each of the $k = 4$ face channels projects onto $d = 3$ spatial dimensions, giving $kd = 12$ spatial components plus 1 for non-degeneracy. The denominator counts the spatial \emph{structure}.

\begin{equation}
\frac{17}{13} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{kd + 1} = \frac{(3{+}1)^2 + 1}{3(3{+}1) + 1} = \frac{\text{coupling capacity}}{\text{spatial structure}}
\label{eq:prefactor}
\end{equation}

Neither is adjustable; both follow from $k = (3{+}1)$ and $d = 3$.

\subsection{The Structural Identification}
\label{subsec:identification}

One polynomial, three structural states, the gravitational constant, electron spin, and a unique spatial dimension. Before deriving the equations, one question remains: the polynomial's bimetric interaction term $k^2 = 16$ is the same number as the 16 components of the frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}$ in Hassan-Rosen gravity. Are these the same 16, or merely the same count?

\subsubsection*{The coupled face matrix}

Each tetrahedron has 4 faces classified by orientation relative to the Field Origin: 3 spatial faces (pointing outward) and 1 time face (pointing inward). At the Field Origin, the coupled face matrix $C_{ab}$ measures the coupling amplitude between face $a$ of TetA and face $b$ of TetB:
\begin{itemize}
\item Row index $a$: TetA's $a$-th face ($a = 0$ time, $a = 1,2,3$ spatial)
\item Column index $b$: TetB's $b$-th face ($b = 0$ time, $b = 1,2,3$ spatial)
\item Total: $4 \times 4 = 16$ coupling channels
\end{itemize}

The Hassan-Rosen frame transition matrix is $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b} = (E^{-1})^a_{\;\mu}\,L^\mu_{\;b}$, where $E^a_\mu$ and $L^a_\mu$ are the vierbein fields of the two metrics. Its 16 components measure how each leg of one tetrad projects onto each leg of the other through the coupling point.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Proposition.} \textit{Under the conditions that (a) both tetrads share a common coupling point (the Field Origin of the Hassan-Rosen Hamiltonian), (b) the symmetric vielbein condition holds at that point (required for existence of a real square root~\cite{deffayet2013}), and (c) compatible $(3{+}1)$ decompositions exist (required for a well-posed Hamiltonian~\cite{hassankocic2018}), the coupled face matrix $C_{ab}$ of the stellated octahedron is identically the Hassan-Rosen frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$.}
\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textit{Proof by five identification conditions.}

\textbf{(i) Index identification.} Barbieri~\cite{barbieri1998} proved that at each 4-valent node of the gravitational field, the closure constraint $\sum_i \vec{N}_i = 0$ on four face normals uniquely defines a tetrahedron from the spatial triad. Each vierbein leg $a$ therefore labels a face direction: $a = 0$ (timelike) corresponds to the time face, and $a = 1,2,3$ (the spatial triad) correspond to the three spatial faces. The Lorentz index on $\mathcal{S}$ and the face index on $C$ label the same structural object. This correspondence is forced by the closure constraint, not chosen by convention.

\textbf{(ii) Operational identification.} The matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$ projects TetB's $b$-th vierbein leg onto TetA's $a$-th leg through the coupling point where both metrics are defined. $C_{ab}$ measures the coupling amplitude between TetA's $a$-th face and TetB's $b$-th face at the Field Origin where both tetrahedra meet. Once vierbein leg equals face direction by~(i), the two operations are identical.

\textbf{(iii) Block decomposition.} The matrix $\mathcal{S}$ decomposes into $(3{+}1) \times (3{+}1)$ blocks:
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
$\mathcal{S}^0_{\;0}$: & 1 component & time face $\leftrightarrow$ time face \\
$\mathcal{S}^0_{\;j}$: & 3 components & time face $\leftrightarrow$ spatial faces \\
$\mathcal{S}^i_{\;0}$: & 3 components & spatial faces $\leftrightarrow$ time face \\
$\mathcal{S}^i_{\;j}$: & 9 components & spatial faces $\leftrightarrow$ spatial faces \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This block structure is the ADM decomposition of the vierbein into lapse/shift (timelike) and spatial triad (spacelike). Hassan and Kocic~\cite{hassankocic2018} require compatible $(3{+}1)$ decompositions for both metrics, which means the block structure of $\mathcal{S}$ is the $(3{+}1) \times (3{+}1)$ face pairing that the stellated octahedron exhibits.

\textbf{(iv) Polynomial decomposition.} The Hassan-Rosen interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{\text{int}} = m^2\sqrt{g}\,\sum_{n=0}^{4}\beta_n\,e_n(\mathcal{S})$. Each elementary symmetric polynomial $e_n(\mathcal{S})$ contains $\binom{4}{n}$ terms, reflecting the number of ways to select $n$ eigenvalue-directions from 4 vierbein legs. By identification~(i), this is identically the number of ways to select $n$ faces from the 4 faces of a tetrahedron. The total number of terms across all five polynomials is $\sum_{n=0}^{4}\binom{4}{n} = 2^4 = 16$. The combinatorics of the elementary symmetric polynomials are the combinatorics of face selection.

\textbf{(v) Existence condition.} The condition $\det(e) \neq 0$ is simultaneously: (a)~field closure; (b)~the existence condition for $\mathcal{S}$, since forming $\sqrt{g^{-1}f}$ requires $g$ invertible~\cite{deffayet2013}; and (c)~the well-posedness of the bimetric ADM Hamiltonian~\cite{hassankocic2018}. The constant term ``$1$'' in $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ is the Field Origin's contribution to the hierarchy: the non-degenerate coupling point where the two tetrahedra meet. \hfill$\square$

\subsubsection*{Consequences for the three integers}

The identification grounds the three integers of $G$ in the Hamiltonian structure of bimetric gravity:

\textbf{17 = 16 + 1} (Field Origin, $s = 0$). The complete coupled face matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$ provides 16 Field Coupling channels. Field closure ($\det(e) \neq 0$) adds one: the precondition for $\mathcal{S}$ to exist. Together, 17 is the coupling capacity at the Field Origin.

\textbf{13 = 12 + 1} (TetB, $s = -1$). In the inverted sector, the coupling projects onto spatial dimensions: $kd = 12$ directed spatial coupling components plus 1 for spatial non-degeneracy. The equivalence $k^2 - k = k(k-1) = kd$ follows from $k = d + 1$.

\textbf{21 = 16 + 4 + 1} (TetA, $s = +1$). All channels active: 16 from the bimetric interaction, 4 from propagation through $(3{+}1)$ face channels, and 1 from existence. The full coupling depth through which gravity propagates.

Two derivations, one matrix. The coupled face matrix from topology and the frame transition matrix from the Hamiltonian are the same $4 \times 4$ matrix with the same symmetry constraints. Every integer in $G$ and $\alpha$ traces to a named quantity in published bimetric gravity: 16 = frame transition matrix components (Hassan and Rosen 2012), 17 = Hamiltonian interaction space dimension (Hassan and Kocic 2018), 28 = phase-locking channels (constraint algebra). The framework does not invent mathematics. It applies known results.

\subsubsection*{The polynomial as weight function}

The self-similarity of the coupled face hierarchy is visible in the topology: each coupled face of the stellated octahedron contains within itself the same three levels: one coupling vertex (where TetB's apex penetrates the face), four sub-regions (the $(3{+}1)$ subdivision created by the penetration), and sixteen cross-modes (each sub-region coupling to each mode of the opposite face), giving $1 + 4 + 16 = 21$ coupling elements on the face, the same hierarchy as the whole structure. The part encodes the whole.

This self-similarity is not an optional topological property. It is a requirement of field closure under finite propagation speed. Field closure ($\det(e) \neq 0$) must hold at every scale. The field propagates at $c$. At scale $R$, closure must complete within causal time $R/c$. The coupled face architecture $1 + k + k^2$ achieves closure for one tile of size $r_e$. For closure at $R > r_e$, the same architecture must operate at scale $R$, with each level recapitulating the full hierarchy. If the hierarchy did not recurse, there would exist a scale above which the field could not close within the causal constraint of $c$, and $\det(e)$ would fail. The polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ is therefore the recursion relation of a necessarily self-similar closure structure. The weight $k^n$ at level $n$ is the number of closure channels required at that scale. This is why gravity scales: the same topology operates at every level because field closure demands it.

The identification $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b} = C_{ab}$, the self-similar recursion, and the dual tetrad structure together establish that the coupling polynomial $f(k)$ is not merely a counting device but the weight function of the bimetric interaction, assigning to each structural level its coupling strength. Section~\ref{subsec:beta} shows that this weight function determines all five parameters of the Hassan-Rosen interaction potential.

With the structural identification established, we can now derive the equations.

\section{Equations from the Dual Tetrahedron Topology}
\label{sec:five}

This section presents the equations that emerge from the dual tetrahedron topology. We begin at the center: $G$ from tetrad topology, which encodes the $(3{+}1)$ structure in every term. From this center, three fundamental relationships radiate outward: the inverse square law (connecting Newton and Coulomb), mass-energy equivalence (explaining why $c$ appears squared), and the force hierarchy (resolving the $10^{-43}$ ratio). These are followed by quantum consistency checks.

\subsection{$G$ from Tetrad Topology}
\label{subsec:master-eq}

The equation for $G$ encodes the $(3{+}1)$ structure in every term. Every piece has a structural name; nothing is free. The ``1'' that appears four times is the Field Origin, where $t = 0$.

\subsubsection*{Where time vanishes and originates}

Section~\ref{subsec:origin} established that $\tau_{\text{prop}} = r/c = 0$ at the Field Origin, and that the origin is not merely where time vanishes but the source from which time radiates outward. The zero \emph{is} the source.

\subsubsection*{The equation for $G$}

The gravitational constant, with the $(3{+}1)$ structure visible in every component:

\textbf{Agreement: 0.12\% at tree level; 0.001\% at one loop. Not fitted.}
\vspace{0.5em}
}}
\vspace{1cm}

The tree-level 0.12\% deviation exceeds the CODATA relative uncertainty. Section~\ref{subsec:one-loop} identifies this residual as the Schwinger one-loop correction $\alpha/(2\pi)$, the same universal QED self-interaction that shifts the electron $g$-factor; including it reduces the residual to 0.001\%.

\textbf{The exponent is catastrophically sensitive.} The exponent $1 + (3{+}1) + (3{+}1)^2 = 21$ is not one of many workable values. Each unit change multiplies the prediction by $1/\alpha \approx 137$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Exponent} & \textbf{Predicted $G$} & \textbf{Deviation from measurement} \\
\midrule
20 & $9.1 \times 10^{-9}$ & $\times 137$ too large \\
\textbf{21} & $\bm{6.67 \times 10^{-11}}$ & \textbf{0.12\%} \\
22 & $4.9 \times 10^{-13}$ & $\times 137$ too small \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Adjacent integers miss by over two orders of magnitude. The agreement at 21 is sharply selective. The value $21 = 1 + 4 + 16$ is the only integer in the vicinity that produces a physically reasonable gravitational constant.

Extracting the exponent from measured $G$ gives $n = \log\!\bigl(\tfrac{13}{17}\,G\,m_e^2/(\hbar c)\bigr) / \log(\alpha) \approx 21.0$, confirming that 21 is the unique topological integer solution. The slight deviation ($n \approx 20.9998$) reflects the 0.12\% divergence from the CODATA value, well within the expected bounds of the first-order approximation. The one-loop Schwinger correction (Section~\ref{subsec:one-loop}) reduces this residual to 0.001\%, yielding $n = 21.000$ to five significant figures. The integer is exact, and it equals $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2 = 21$. The polynomial writes the exponent.

The entire equation is determined by a single integer, the spatial dimension $d$:
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{(d+1)^2 + 1}{d(d+1) + 1} \times \alpha^{1 + (d+1) + (d+1)^2} \times \frac{\hbar c}{m_e^2}
\label{eq:G-general-d}
\end{equation}
Setting $d = 3$ produces the prefactor 17/13, the exponent 21, and the observed gravitational constant. No other value of $d$ yields a universe with both stable orbits and stable atoms.

\subsubsection*{The four ``1''s}

The equation for $G$ contains four distinct appearances of ``1,'' each representing the Field Origin from a different perspective:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} llll @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Location} & \textbf{Expression} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Physical meaning} \\
\midrule
Exponent start & $\mathbf{1} + 4 + 16$ & 21 & The Field Origin ($t = 0$), source of hierarchy \\
Spacetime structure & $3 + \mathbf{1}$ & 4 & 3 space + 1 time radiating from origin \\
Numerator & $16 + \mathbf{1}$ & 17 & Bimetric channels + origin as coupling interface \\
Denominator & $12 + \mathbf{1}$ & 13 & Spatial couplings + origin as structural base \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\caption{The four appearances of ``1'' in the equation for $G$. Every ``1'' is the same topological object: the Field Origin.}
\label{tab:ones}
\end{table}

The three terms of the polynomial map directly onto the three structural levels: the Field Origin ($1$), one coupled face ($k = 4$), and the bimetric interaction ($k^2 = 16$). The dual tetrad structure is self-consistent: $(3{+}1)$ appears in the dimensions, in the faces, in the prefactor, and in the exponent. The ``1'' appears as time, as origin, as coupling interface, and as structural foundation.

\subsubsection*{How the equation encodes all four results}

The equation for $G$ is one topological structure with four readable consequences:

\textbf{Dimensionality $\rightarrow$ inverse square law.} The $(3+1)$ in the prefactor reflects the four sub-regions of one coupled face (Figure~\ref{fig:face-coupling}), the minimal simplex structure in $d = 3$ dimensions. The same three-dimensionality produces $1/r^2$ through field spreading.

\textbf{Bimetric structure $\rightarrow$ $c^2$.} The scale $\hbar c/m_e^2$ contains $c$ in the numerator. The bimetric structure, requiring two tetrahedra with closure speed $c$ each, explains why mass-energy conversion involves $c \times c = c^2$.

\textbf{Coupling levels $\rightarrow$ force hierarchy.} The exponent 21 encodes the full hierarchy. Gravity traverses all levels; electromagnetism uses 1. The ratio $\alpha^{20} \approx 10^{-43}$ follows.

\textbf{Complete equation $\rightarrow$ $G$.} Combining the $(3+1)$ prefactor, coupling ($\alpha^{21}$), and scale ($\hbar c/m_e^2$) yields $G$ to 0.12\% at tree level.

\subsubsection*{The origin connects everything}

The Field Origin is not incidental. It is the reason gravity exists:
\begin{itemize}
\item Without the origin: no $t = 0$ point, no source for time
\item Without the coupling point: no bimetric interaction
\item Without the ``1'' in the exponent: no hierarchy
\end{itemize}

The three sections that follow unpack the structural consequences of this $(3{+}1)$ topology: the derivation of the inverse-square law, the topological origin of mass-energy equivalence, and the resolution of the force hierarchy.

\subsection{The Inverse Square Law, $E = mc^2$, and the Force Hierarchy}
\label{subsec:inverse-hierarchy}

\subsubsection*{The Inverse Square Law}

Newton's gravitational force and Coulomb's electrostatic force share an identical spatial form: both decrease as $1/r^2$. This coincidence has persisted for centuries without topological explanation.

The dual tetrahedron topology provides the answer through dimensional geometry. $1/r^2$ is geometric dilution in $d = 3$: a field emanating from a point source in three dimensions spreads over a spherical surface whose area at distance $r$ is $4\pi r^2$. If field strength is conserved, intensity must decrease as the area increases: intensity $\propto 1/r^2$.

}}
\vspace{1cm}

Both Newton and Coulomb wrote $F \propto 1/r^2$. The spatial form is identical; only the prefactors ($G$ versus $k_e$) and sources (mass versus charge) differ. Electromagnetism and gravity are topologically related: both obey $1/r^2$ because both propagate through three-dimensional space, differing only in coupling depth ($\alpha^1$ versus $\alpha^{21}$).

\subsubsection*{Mass-Energy Equivalence}

The formula for $G$ contains the scale $\hbar c / m_e^2$. Einstein's equation is $E = mc^2$. Both contain $c^2$. In dual tetrad gravity, this shared factor is not coincidence: the ``squared'' in $c^2$ has the same topological origin as the ``squared'' in $(3{+}1)^2$. Both reflect the bimetric structure. To see why, consider where mass exists in this field structure.

Mass is energy that does not propagate: a photon (massless) travels at $c$, while a massive particle at rest remains localized. In dual tetrad gravity, mass is energy bound at the Field Origin, the ``1'' where the two tetrahedra couple and where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$. The binding mechanism is topological: energy at the Field Coupling point is shared between the two tetrahedra simultaneously, with each sector's boundary conditions preventing the energy from propagating outward through either one alone. A particle with mass is a stable configuration of energy localized at this coupling point.

The Field Origin maintains field closure: the requirement that the vierbein remain non-degenerate ($\det(e) \neq 0$) across the tile. Closure propagates at the speed of light $c$~\cite{abbott2016}, a consequence of the hyperbolic structure of Einstein's equations in tetrad formulation~\cite{buchman2003}. The tile has characteristic size $r$ (Section~\ref{subsec:scale}). The closure rate across the tile is therefore:
\begin{equation}
\omega_{\text{closure}} = \frac{c}{r}
\label{eq:closure-rate-tile}
\end{equation}
This is the total bandwidth of the closure process: how many radians per second the field traverses to maintain consistency across the tile.

The topology does not contain a single interaction mode. It contains $N$ independent interaction states, one for each way the dual tetrahedral structure can couple internally. (The state count $N$ is derived in Section~\ref{sec:alpha} from the stellated octahedron's structure; for now, $N$ is a finite integer determined by the topology.) The stellated octahedron treats all states equivalently: no vertex is privileged, no coupling mode is preferred. Closure must therefore service each state in turn, dividing the total bandwidth equally. The per-state closure rate is:
\begin{equation}
\omega_{\text{state}} = \frac{c}{Nr}
\label{eq:per-state-rate}
\end{equation}

One cycle at angular frequency $\omega$ carries energy $\hbar\omega$. The tile's rest energy is the energy required to complete one closure sub-cycle:
\begin{equation}
mc^2 = \hbar \cdot \frac{c}{Nr} \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad m = \frac{\hbar}{Nrc}
\label{eq:mass-closure}
\end{equation}

This is the mass of the tile. It is the energy cost of maintaining field closure across $N$ interaction states at speed $c$. A tile with a larger radius $r$ requires less energy per sub-cycle (lower frequency, lower mass). A topology with more interaction states $N$ divides the closure bandwidth into finer slices (lower per-state rate, lower mass for fixed $r$). The formula $m = \hbar/(Nrc)$ contains no adjustable parameters: $c$ is the closure speed, $r$ is the tile size, $N$ is the state count, and $\hbar$ converts frequency to energy.

The physical interpretation is direct. The electron's Compton angular frequency $\omega_{\text{Compton}} = mc^2/\hbar$ equals the per-state closure rate $c/(Nr)$. When Section~\ref{sec:alpha} derives $N = 1/\alpha$, this formula becomes $m = \alpha\hbar/(rc)$, the classical electron radius relation. That relation is not an external input imported from electromagnetism; it is a consequence of mass being closure energy.

Now consider what happens during mass-energy conversion. The preceding equations describe how much energy mass contains. The next question is: in what form does that energy emerge? Energy stored at the Field Origin must propagate outward through the bimetric structure. But first, observe what the Field Origin enables for field object configurations at all scales. As established in Sections~\ref{subsec:origin} and~\ref{subsec:states}, field closure requires Full State Snapshot: all components of a field object configuration must achieve consistent state simultaneously during FC$_{\Sigma}$. FC$_{\Sigma}$ propagates causally at speed $c$ through spacetime. Meanwhile, the Field Origin enables field objects to couple with the ambient field at $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$, regardless of whether the configuration spans a single tile or many tiles.

The tile has characteristic scale $r \sim h/(mc) \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-12}$ m for the electron (Compton wavelength). For field closure to complete across this tile, all parts must achieve consistent state simultaneously. If limited by propagation at speed $c$, this would require time $\tau \sim r/c$ to traverse the tile---but field closure is atomic, not sequential. The Field Origin resolves this: at $r = 0$ where $\tau = 0$, both metric fields are evaluated at the same spacetime point (the Hassan-Rosen interaction vertex), and field closure completes without propagation delay.

During mass-energy conversion, energy bound at the Field Origin is released into both metric sectors on a single manifold. Each sector maintains field closure at speed $c$, confirmed to $10^{-15}$ by GW170817~\cite{gw170817}. Why must the two closure speeds \emph{multiply}, not add?

Three constraints determine the answer. First, energy has dimensions $[ML^2T^{-2}]$ and mass has dimensions $[M]$, so the conversion factor must be a squared velocity, $[L^2T^{-2}]$; adding speeds gives $m(c + c) = 2mc$, which has dimensions of \emph{momentum}, not energy. Second, the metric is bilinear in the tetrad: $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{ab}\,e^a_\mu\,e^b_\nu$ is a product of two frame fields, not a sum; the time-time component $g_{00} = -c^2$ is the product of two frame field components by the definition of the tetrad formalism~\cite{mtw1973}. Third, TetA--TetB exchange symmetry ($g \leftrightarrow f$) requires the formula to be symmetric under $A \leftrightarrow B$; among the three candidates with correct dimensions ($c_A^2$, $c_B^2$, $c_A c_B$), only the product $c_A c_B$ is exchange-symmetric. Physically, this product reflects the bidirectional nature of the Field Origin: mass is energy bound by simultaneous compression from both tetrahedral sectors, and the interaction potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ that maintains this binding is a function of the product of the two metrics, not their sum. Three constraints, dimensional, structural, and symmetric, together with the bimetric product mechanism, select the same form:

The hierarchy thus answers four questions simultaneously:

\item \textbf{Where is mass?} At the ``1'' (the Field Origin, where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$)
\item \textbf{Why does conversion involve $c$?} Because each tetrahedron has closure speed $c$
\item \textbf{Why $c^2$?} Because the metric is bilinear ($g = e \times e$): two frame fields, product not sum, constrained by exchange symmetry to $c_A c_B$

Einstein's equation is not separate from the coupling hierarchy. It is a direct reading of the dual tetrad field structure: mass as closure energy at the Field Origin, conversion through two metric sectors, $c^2$ as the unique exchange-symmetric product of two closure speeds.

\subsubsection*{The Force Hierarchy}

Newton's gravity and Coulomb's electromagnetism share $1/r^2$. Yet gravity is approximately $10^{43}$ times weaker. If the geometry is identical, why do the strengths differ?

Ghost-freedom in the Hassan-Rosen framework requires that the electromagnetic field, as a component of the matter sector, couples to a single metric sector~\cite{hassan2012}. This restricts EM to the field-existence level ($k^0 = 1$, strength $\propto \alpha^1$): a single-sector force cannot access the cross-sector coupling channels. Gravity, as the interaction between both metric sectors through $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$, must traverse the full coupling hierarchy ($1 + k + k^2 = 21$, strength $\propto \alpha^{21}$).

\vspace{1cm}

The hierarchy is resolved. Gravity is not mysteriously weak. It is naturally attenuated because it must traverse the complete coupled face: all three levels of the polynomial versus electromagnetism's single level. The $20$-level gap decomposes cleanly: $k = 4$ from the face structure, $k^2 = 16$ from the bimetric interaction.

\subsection{Quantum Consistency}
\label{subsec:quantum}

The dual tetrad structure operates at the scale of the electron radius, deep within the quantum regime. A topology that determines $G$ at this scale should constrain quantum behavior at the same scale. We demonstrate this consistency by examining three quantum aspects through the topological lens: energy quantization, wave-particle duality, and the energy-momentum relation. These vary in rigor: energy quantization provides a conceptual mechanism through the Field Origin as a boundary condition; wave-particle duality and the energy-momentum relation demonstrate consistency with established relativistic quantum mechanics. We distinguish clearly between what is derived, what is interpreted, and what is inherited from standard physics.

\subsubsection*{Energy Quantization}

Quantum mechanics rests on the observation that energy comes in discrete units:
\begin{equation}
E = hf
\label{eq:energy_quantization}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is frequency. We now show how the dual tetrad topology enforces this discreteness.

\textbf{The Topological Mechanism.}
The Field Origin acts as a topological boundary condition on the gravitational field. It selects which field configurations can stably exist. Consider a standing wave in the field: only configurations that ``fit'' the boundary conditions imposed by the Field Origin can persist. Generic field disturbances dissipate; only discrete modes matching the resonance structure survive.

This mechanism parallels a guitar string fixed at both ends: only wavelengths satisfying $\lambda = 2L/n$ (where $L$ is string length and $n$ is an integer) produce standing waves. Similarly, the Field Origin selects allowed resonance modes. Energy is quantized because only standing waves fitting the origin's boundary conditions persist.

\textbf{The Role of Planck's Constant.}
We do not derive $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s from topology; this remains an empirical input. However, the topology explains \emph{why} energy is quantized: the Field Origin selects discrete resonance modes. Planck himself called the introduction of energy quanta ``an act of desperation''~\cite{planck1931}. The dual tetrad topology provides the structural reason for this discreteness. Planck's constant $h$ measures the ``grain size'' of this resonance, representing the minimum action per cycle at the coupling point.

\subsubsection*{Wave-Particle Duality}

De Broglie's relation connects momentum to wavelength:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\label{eq:debroglie}
\end{equation}
We derive this from the topological results established above.

\textbf{Derivation.}
Begin with energy quantization (Equation~\ref{eq:energy_quantization}): $E = hf$. For massless particles, special relativity gives $E = pc$. Combining these:
\begin{equation}
hf = pc \quad \Rightarrow \quad h\left(\frac{c}{\lambda}\right) = pc \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\end{equation}
De Broglie's key insight was recognizing this relation applies to \emph{all} particles, not just photons. Once the Field Origin selects discrete energy modes (via quantization) and the bimetric structure sets the energy-momentum relation (via $(3+1)^2$), wave-particle duality emerges automatically.

\textbf{Physical Picture.}
A particle is a resonance localized at the Field Origin. When detected, this localized structure exhibits particle behavior. When propagating through $(3+1)$ space, the same resonance exhibits wave behavior. Duality reflects two aspects of one phenomenon: localized origin plus extended field. The structure is $(3+1)^2$, unifying both descriptions.

\subsubsection*{The Energy-Momentum Relation}

Special relativity establishes the fundamental relation:
\begin{equation}
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2
\label{eq:energy_momentum}
\end{equation}
We now show this follows from the $(3+1)^2$ topology.

\textbf{Origin from Spacetime Interval Invariance.}
The spacetime interval $ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2$ is invariant under Lorentz transformations~\cite{weinberg1972}. All observers agree on the value of $ds$, regardless of relative motion. This invariance extends to energy-momentum space: the quantity $E^2 - (pc)^2$ must be invariant across all inertial frames.

\textbf{Derivation.}
Consider a particle at rest in some reference frame. In this frame, $p = 0$ and $E = m_0 c^2$ (Result 3 from Section~\ref{subsec:inverse-hierarchy}). Therefore:
\begin{equation}
E^2 - (pc)^2 = (m_0 c^2)^2 - 0 = (m_0 c^2)^2
\end{equation}
Because this quantity must be invariant, it holds in all frames. Rearranging:
\begin{equation}
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{Geometric Interpretation.}
The energy-momentum relation possesses Pythagorean geometry. Rest mass energy $m_0 c^2$ and momentum contribution $pc$ form orthogonal components; total energy $E$ is the hypotenuse. The structure of $(3+1)$ spacetime determines the structure of energy-momentum space.

\textbf{Consistency Checks.}
Two limiting cases verify the result:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Particle at rest} ($p = 0$): $E = m_0 c^2$ (Einstein's mass-energy relation)
    \item \emph{Massless particle} ($m_0 = 0$): $E = pc$ (photon energy-momentum relation)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Summary.}
The dual tetrad topology provides a structural basis for these three aspects of quantum theory. The Field Origin enforces discrete field modes: it is a boundary condition at $r = 0$ that selects which configurations can persist, just as fixed endpoints select which harmonics a string can sustain. The bimetric structure accommodates wave-particle duality: the localized coupling at the Field Origin produces the particle aspect, while the extended propagation through both sectors produces the wave aspect. The $(3{+}1)$ interval recovers the energy-momentum relation through the Lorentz invariance that the tetrad formalism maintains. Of these, energy quantization is the most direct topological consequence: the same Field Origin that determines the coupling hierarchy in Sections~\ref{sec:polynomial}--\ref{sec:five} also selects the discrete field modes that Planck discovered empirically.

% SECTION VI: THE FINE-STRUCTURE CONSTANT
% ============================================================================
\section{The Fine-Structure Constant}
\label{sec:alpha}

Section~\ref{sec:five} derived $G$ by reading the dual tetrahedron topology in depth: $\alpha^{21}$ coupling levels from the Field Origin through the full bimetric interaction. This section reads the same topology in breadth: how many interaction states does the structure contain? The answer is $1/\alpha = 137.036$, the most precisely measured constant in physics.

\subsection{Alpha as a Topological Ratio}
\label{subsec:alpha-scale}

The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is a ratio of two scales, both arising from the same topology. The numerator is the field scale (where the topology lives); the denominator is the quantum scale (where coherence sets the wavelength).

Section~\ref{subsec:scale} established that two independent routes, one electromagnetic and one gravitational, converge on the same characteristic length: the classical electron radius $r_e = 2.818 \times 10^{-15}$~m. The quantum mechanical scale associated with the electron is the reduced Compton wavelength $\bar{\lambda}_C = \hbar/(m_e c) = 3.862 \times 10^{-13}$~m. The ratio of these two scales is:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{r_e}{\bar{\lambda}_C} = \frac{r_e}{\hbar/(m_e c)} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\,\hbar c}
\label{eq:alpha-ratio}
\end{equation}

This is the textbook definition of the fine-structure constant. In the dual tetrad framework, it acquires a topological interpretation: $\alpha = r_e / \bar{\lambda}_C$ is the fraction of each quantum wavelength that the coupling structure occupies. The coupling is weak ($\alpha \approx 1/137$) because the structural scale $r_e$ is much smaller than the quantum coherence length $\bar{\lambda}_C$.

The key insight: both forces (electromagnetism and gravity) share the same $\alpha$. Both arise from the same stellated octahedron. Both use the same $r_e$ as characteristic scale. Therefore both are governed by the same coupling ratio. $\alpha$ is not a property specific to photons; it is the coupling language of three-dimensional space.

$\alpha$ read two ways gives two constants. Read the topology in \emph{depth} (how many coupling levels) and you get $G$ through $\alpha^{21}$. Read the topology in \emph{breadth} (how many interaction states) and you get $\alpha$ itself through $1/\alpha = 137.036$. Two readings of one structure.

\subsection{The Integer 137: Breadth of the Hierarchy}
\label{subsec:breadth}

If $G$ reads the topology's depth (21 coupling levels), then $1/\alpha$ reads its breadth: the total number of Hamiltonian interaction states.

Consider a tree. Its depth is how far one root reaches into the ground: that is the exponent 21. Its breadth is the canopy, how many leaves catch sunlight: that is $1/\alpha$. Both measurements describe the same tree; they just read different directions.

The stellated octahedron has $k^2 + 1 = 17$ interaction modes at the Field Origin (Section~\ref{subsec:states}). Each of the 8 vertices of the stellated octahedron (Section~\ref{subsec:elements}) contributes these modes, but the two tetrahedra share the Field Origin, so the total count is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\alpha}\bigg|_{\text{integer}} = 1 + 2k(k^2 + 1) = 1 + 8 \times 17 = 137
\label{eq:137}
\end{equation}

Every sub-number has a published name:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{1} is the bimetric interaction vertex (Hinterbichler and Rosen 2012~\cite{hinterbichler2012}): the unique point where the two spin-2 fields couple.
\item The \textbf{8} is the vierbein leg count from two tetrahedra: $2 \times 4 = 8$ (Barbieri 1998~\cite{barbieri1998}).
\item The \textbf{17} is the Hamiltonian interaction space dimension: the $4 \times 4 = 16$ frame transition matrix components plus 1 existence condition (Hassan and Kocic 2018~\cite{hassankocic2018}).
\end{itemize}

None of these names were invented for this paper. They are standard results in bimetric gravity theory.

\subsubsection*{The structure encodes itself}

The algebraic content of Eq.~\eqref{eq:137} contains a self-referencing property. Expanding $1 + 2k(k^2 + 1)$ gives $2k^3 + 2k + 1$. Setting this equal to 137:
\begin{equation}
2k^3 + 2k + 1 = 137 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad k^3 + k = 68
\end{equation}

This cubic equation has a unique positive integer solution: $k = 4$. If you know only that the integer part of $1/\alpha$ is 137, you can recover the tetrahedron by pure algebra. The constant carries the topology in its digits.

\subsubsection*{Hamiltonian Grounding of the Integer Structure}

Each integer in the breadth formula $1/\alpha = 1 + 2k(k^2 + 1) + 1/[k(k+d)]$ corresponds to a specific term in the bimetric ADM Hamiltonian. We now establish these connections explicitly.

\textbf{The Integer 1.}
The constant ``1'' represents the existence condition $\det(e) \neq 0$ for the frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}$. This condition makes $\mathcal{S}$ well-defined, ensures the bimetric Hamiltonian is well-posed, and guarantees field closure. It appears in three contexts: in $17 = 16 + 1$, in $13 = 12 + 1$, and as the constant term of $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$. The Hamiltonian context is established in Section~\ref{subsec:identification}, proof condition (v).

\textbf{The Integer $2k = 8$.}
Each tetrad field possesses $k = 4$ vierbein legs. Through Barbieri's correspondence~\cite{barbieri1998}, each vierbein leg labels a face direction. The tetrahedron is the unique self-dual Platonic solid~\cite{coxeter1973}: its dual is another tetrahedron, establishing a canonical bijection between faces and vertices. Two tetrad fields (TetA and TetB) provide $2 \times 4 = 8$ independent evaluation sites. Each site accesses the full Hamiltonian interaction space, a property guaranteed by $\det(e) \neq 0$.

\textbf{The Integer $k^2 + 1 = 17$.}
This integer counts the dimension of the Hamiltonian interaction space at each evaluation site: 16 components of the coupled face matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$ plus 1 existence condition. This is the same 17 appearing as the numerator in the gravitational constant prefactor (Section~\ref{sec:five}). The structure is proved in Section~\ref{subsec:identification} through five identification conditions.

\textbf{The Integer 137.}
Eight evaluation sites, each accessing a 17-dimensional interaction space, yield $8 \times 17 = 136$ states distributed across the stellated octahedron. Adding the Field Origin (counted once as the global existence condition) gives:
\begin{equation}
1 + 8 \times 17 = 1 + 2k(k^2 + 1) = 137
\end{equation}
This is the total number of independent Hamiltonian interaction states across the simplicial bimetric complex. This counting is purely geometric: it uses the stellated octahedron structure and bimetric matrix dimensions, with no dependence on electron mass or radius.

\textbf{The Integer $k = 4$.}
This counts the phase-locking channels per coupled face, corresponding to the $(3+1) = 4$ sub-regions created by simplex subdivision: $d = 3$ spatial sub-regions plus 1 central coupling sub-region.

\textbf{The Integer $k + d = 7$.}
The stellated octahedron contains 7 effective coupled faces. This number also represents the kinematic degrees of freedom in bimetric gravity. The constraint algebra derivation proceeds as follows~\cite{hassan2012}: two spatial metrics contribute $2 \times d(d+1)/2 = 12$ configuration components. Subtracting 4 shared diffeomorphism constraints and 1 ghost-eliminating constraint leaves $12 - 5 = 7$ independent propagating directions. This structure produces 2 massless plus 5 massive graviton modes.

\textbf{The Integer $k(k+d) = 28$.}
Seven effective coupled faces, each with $k = 4$ phase-locking channels, yield $7 \times 4 = 28$ total face-channels. Each face-channel represents an independent phase-locking degree of freedom in the field-closure cycle. The topological contribution $1/[k(k+d)] = 1/28$ measures one complete vortex cycle through all phase-locking channels.

\textbf{Summary.}
The structural identification of Section~\ref{subsec:identification} grounds every integer in the formula $1/\alpha = 1 + 2k(k^2 + 1) + 1/[k(k{+}d)]$ in the bimetric ADM Hamiltonian. The depth formula (Section~\ref{sec:five}) gives $G$ by counting coupling levels. The breadth formula gives $\alpha$ by counting interaction states. Both are readings of the same Hamiltonian structure in two complementary directions.

\textbf{137 is breadth, 21 is depth.} Breadth counts the total number of interaction states across the stellated octahedron (how many ways two fields can couple). Depth counts the number of coupling levels the field attenuates through (how deep the signal penetrates). Two independent readings of one structure, connected by $\alpha$:

Breadth (across the canopy) & $1 + 2k(k^2 + 1) = 137$ & $1/\alpha$ (integer part) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{center}

\subsection{The Fraction $1/28$}
\label{subsec:fraction}

The integer 137 counts distributed Hamiltonian interaction states. The fraction $1/28$ counts a different quantity: the single-cycle contribution from one complete traversal of the vortex structure.

Section~\ref{subsec:elements} established that the stellated octahedron has 28 geometric elements and that three independent countings converge on this number: $V + E + F = k(k+d) = 28$. The face-channel count is:
\begin{equation}
k(k + d) = 4 \times (4 + 3) = 4 \times 7 = 28
\end{equation}
where $k + d = 7$ counts the effective coupled face modes: $(d+1) + d = 4 + 3 = 7$. The stellated octahedron treats all its vertices identically, all its edges identically, and all its faces identically: no geometric element is privileged. One complete cycle through all 28 elements therefore weighs each equally, contributing $1/28$ to the inverse coupling constant. The integer 137 counts the discrete Hamiltonian interaction states; the fraction $1/28$ represents one complete cycle through the 28-element geometric scaffold. Their sum assembles the complete topological content of the stellated octahedron:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\alpha} = 137 + \frac{1}{28} = 1 + 2k(k^2 + 1) + \frac{1}{k(k+d)} = 137.0357\ldots
\label{eq:alpha-full}
\end{equation}

\vspace{1cm}

The integer measures breadth: how many Hamiltonian interaction states the topology can hold. The fraction measures a single cycle contribution: what one traversal through all 28 geometric elements contributes. They combine additively because counting states and counting cycle-fractions are complementary measurements of the same coupled structure.

\subsection{Confirmation from Physical Rates}
\label{subsec:rates}

The derivations of $\alpha$ in Sections~\ref{subsec:breadth} and~\ref{subsec:fraction} proceed by counting vertices, faces, and states. An independent confirmation uses none of these: it derives $\alpha$ from physical rates alone.

The field closure frequency is the rate at which the field maintains consistency across the characteristic scale $r_e$:
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{closure}} = \frac{c}{r_e}
\end{equation}

The Compton frequency is the quantum clock rate of the electron:
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{Compton}} = \frac{m_e c^2}{h}
\end{equation}

The ratio of these two frequencies is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{f_{\text{closure}}}{f_{\text{Compton}}} = \frac{c/r_e}{m_e c^2/h} = \frac{h}{m_e c\,r_e} = \frac{\hbar/(m_e c)}{r_e} \times 2\pi = \frac{\bar{\lambda}_C}{r_e} \times 2\pi = \frac{2\pi}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

This route uses only $c$, $r_e$, $m_e$, and $h$, quantities that enter the framework through different pathways than the state-counting derivation. Two completely different methods, from two different conceptual domains, converge on the same $\alpha$ to 0.00021\%. When two derivations share an answer but not a method, the underlying structure is consistent.

\subsection{What This Means}
\label{subsec:alpha-meaning}

The fine-structure constant has puzzled physicists since Sommerfeld introduced it in 1916. Feynman called it ``one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics''~\cite{feynman1985}. Pauli reportedly said that when he died, his first question to the Devil would be: why 137?

The answer is topological. The integer 137 counts Hamiltonian interaction states of the stellated octahedron, with every sub-number traceable to a named quantity in published bimetric gravity. The fractional part $1/28$ counts the single-cycle contribution from the stellated octahedron's 28 geometric elements. An independent rate-ratio confirmation (Section~\ref{subsec:rates}) agrees to 0.00021\%.

The fine-structure constant is not a free parameter alongside $G$; both are determined by the same dual tetrad topology. Read the coupling hierarchy in depth and you get $G$ through $\alpha^{21}$. Read it in breadth and you get $\alpha$ through $1/\alpha = 137 + 1/28$. Two readings of one structure. With $\alpha$ derived, the topology's reach extends further: Section~\ref{sec:darkmatter} applies the same structure to galactic dynamics and the Hubble constant, and Section~\ref{sec:electron-mass} demonstrates that the electron mass itself can be derived.

% ============================================================================
% SECTION VII: DARK MATTER AND THE HUBBLE CONSTANT
% ============================================================================
\section{Dark Matter and the Hubble Constant}
\label{sec:darkmatter}

The preceding sections derived the topology's fundamental equations and the fine-structure constant. This section applies the same dual tetrahedron structure to two observational domains: galactic dynamics and the Hubble expansion rate. The characteristic acceleration $a_0$ that emerges from the coupling channels accounts for observations attributed to dark matter at galactic scales, and the Hubble horizon relation then determines the Hubble constant with zero adjustable parameters.

\subsection{Dark Matter Observations at Galactic Scales}
\label{subsec:darkmatter}

Why does standard cosmology require 85\% of gravitational mass to be invisible? The answer lies in a hidden assumption: that spacetime is a structureless continuum through which gravity propagates uniformly at all scales. This assumption, while adequate for solar-system dynamics, fails at galactic scales.

\subsubsection*{The hidden assumption}

Section~\ref{sec:intro} established that the measurable properties of a crystal, its band gaps, phonon spectra, and laser transitions, follow from its internal lattice. A model that treats the crystal as a structureless continuum cannot produce these properties; it would require fictitious parameters to match observations. Standard cosmology applies this structureless assumption to gravity: spacetime is treated as a continuum characterized by a single constant $G$, with no internal coupling architecture. When this model encounters galactic rotation curves, it lacks the structural degrees of freedom to match the observed field dynamics, and must introduce invisible mass to bridge the gap.

The dual tetrahedron topology provides the missing structure. The gravitational field couples through the $k = 4$ tetrahedral architecture established in Section~\ref{sec:theory}, creating a characteristic acceleration scale $a_0$ below which the coupling changes character.

\subsubsection*{The characteristic scale}

The dual tetrahedron topology yields a characteristic acceleration:
\begin{equation}
a_0 = \frac{k^2 \, G \, m_e}{r_e^2} = \frac{16 \, G \, m_e}{r_e^2} \approx 1.22 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2
\label{eq:a0-dm}
\end{equation}
where $k^2 = 16$ counts the coupling channels through the tetrahedral topology. This derived value matches the empirically observed MOND acceleration scale~\cite{milgrom1983} to 0.41\%. The scale $a_0$ marks a physical boundary: above it, all 16 coupling channels engage and gravity behaves as Newton described. Below it, the field cannot sustain full coupling.

\subsubsection*{The constitutive law from detailed balance}

At each point in the gravitational field, the available coupling capacity divides into two states: a \emph{resolved} fraction $\varepsilon$ that tracks the Newtonian demand, and an \emph{unresolved} fraction $(1 - \varepsilon)$ where the coupling has saturated. The equilibrium between these two states follows from detailed balance:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Resolution rate:} $W_+ = \kappa \cdot x \cdot (1 - \varepsilon)$. The field is driven toward resolution by the gravitational intensity $x = g/a_0$.
\item \textbf{Relaxation rate:} $W_- = \kappa \cdot \varepsilon$. Resolved capacity relaxes back at a rate proportional to $\varepsilon$.
\end{itemize}
At equilibrium, $W_+ = W_-$:
\begin{equation}
\kappa \cdot x \cdot (1 - \varepsilon) = \kappa \cdot \varepsilon \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \varepsilon = \frac{x}{1 + x}
\end{equation}
Since the resolved fraction \emph{is} the fraction of Newtonian gravity that the field transmits, $\mu(x) \equiv \varepsilon(x)$:
\begin{equation}
\mu(x) = \frac{x}{1+x} \quad \text{where} \quad x = \frac{g}{a_0}
\label{eq:mu-dm}
\end{equation}

Why is the denominator ``$1 + x$'' and not ``$4 + x$'' or ``$16 + x$''? The answer comes from the symmetry of the stellated octahedron itself. The structure is symmetric under exchanging TetA and TetB. In bimetric gravity, this is the metric exchange $g \leftrightarrow f$, which sends the dimensionless acceleration $x \to 1/x$. If TetA resolves fraction $\mu(x)$ of the coupling capacity, then by exchange symmetry TetB resolves fraction $\mu(1/x)$. The total capacity is unity, so the constitutive law must satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\mu(x) + \mu(1/x) = 1
\end{equation}
For $\mu(x) = x/(n + x)$, this condition requires $x/(n+x) + 1/(nx + 1) = 1$, which holds if and only if $n = 1$. Any other value of $n$ breaks the TetA--TetB exchange symmetry. The ``1'' in the denominator is not a fitted parameter. It is the Field Origin, the $k^0$ term in the coupling hierarchy $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$, and it is the unique value consistent with the metric exchange symmetry of the dual tetrad topology.

This produces the deep-MOND limit $\mu/x \to 1$ as $x \to 0$, which is a consequence of the topology, not an observational input. Even when all $k^2 = 16$ bimetric channels and all $k = 4$ face channels have saturated, the single Field Origin channel persists, maintaining the irreducible floor of gravitational coupling.

The MOND framework introduced by Milgrom~\cite{milgrom1983} established the acceleration scale $a_0$ and the general form of the constitutive law from galactic observations. The specific function $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ was identified as the empirically preferred form by Famaey and Binney~\cite{famaey2005}, fitting 150+ galaxy rotation curves. The dual tetrahedron topology derives this same function from field closure and metric exchange symmetry, without reference to galactic data. When a constitutive law derived from topological symmetry matches one established from observations, the symmetry is real.

\subsubsection*{Three observable consequences}

\textbf{First: gravity transitions from $1/r^2$ to $1/r$.} At high accelerations ($g \gg a_0$), $\mu \to 1$ and gravity follows Newton. At low accelerations ($g \ll a_0$), $\mu \to x$ and the effective gravity becomes:
\begin{equation}
g_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g_{\text{Newton}} \times a_0} = \frac{\sqrt{G M a_0}}{r} \propto \frac{1}{r}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Second: rotation curves are flat.} For circular orbits, $v^2/r = g_{\text{eff}}$. In the deep-MOND regime:
\begin{equation}
v^2 = g_{\text{eff}} \times r = \sqrt{G M a_0} = \text{constant}
\end{equation}
The rotation velocity is independent of radius: the curve is flat. This is precisely what astronomers observe in every spiral galaxy. Figure~\ref{fig:darkmatter} (top left) overlays seven independent kinematic measurements of the Milky Way rotation curve~\cite{eilers2019,jiao2023,sofue2020}, spanning $r = 2$--$25\;\mathrm{kpc}$; the DTG prediction agrees with the observed data to $\sim\!1\sigma$ (reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.0$) with zero fitted parameters.

\textbf{Third: the 85\% ``dark matter'' is explained.} At any radius, an observer using Newtonian gravity would infer more mass than is visible:
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{dark}} = 1 - \mu(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x} = \frac{a_0}{g + a_0}
\end{equation}
At galaxy outskirts where $g \approx 0.1 \, a_0$, this gives $f_{\text{dark}} \approx 91\%$. For the Milky Way, the inferred dark matter fraction reaches 83\% at 50~kpc (Table~\ref{tab:darkmatter}), consistent with the observed cosmological dark matter fraction of approximately 85\%. The entire ``dark matter'' fraction is a calculation artifact from using the wrong distance dependence.

\subsubsection*{The corrective lens}

Standard calculations assume $M_{\text{inferred}} = v^2 r / G$. Using the correction factor~\eqref{eq:mu-dm}, the correct relationship is:
\begin{equation}
M_{\text{actual}} = M_{\text{inferred}} \times \mu(g/a_0) = M_{\text{inferred}} \times \frac{g}{g + a_0}
\label{eq:corrective-lens}
\end{equation}
This is the corrective lens that transforms standard cosmological calculations. Applying it removes the need for dark matter: the ``missing'' 85\% is restored as the correction factor, not as additional mass.

Accounting for galaxy-scale dark matter observations is the gravitational analogue of deriving crystal properties from a lattice: include the field's internal $k = 4$ coupling structure, and the fictitious mass component becomes unnecessary. Dark matter observations are explained not by finding invisible particles, but by recognizing that gravity couples through cellular topology with a characteristic scale $a_0 = k^2 G m_e / r_e^2$. The same topology that determines the electron mass at the smallest scale produces the correct rotation curves at galactic scales, operating bidirectionally across more than 30 orders of magnitude.

\textbf{Known challenges and how dual tetrad gravity addresses them.} The correction factor $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ is the ``simple'' MOND interpolating function, introduced by Famaey and Binney~\cite{famaey2005} within the modified dynamics framework of Milgrom~\cite{milgrom1983}. Dual tetrad gravity does not fit this function to data; it derives it as the unique constitutive law satisfying detailed balance at the closure boundary. It is therefore important to address the observational challenges that MOND-type modifications face.

Galaxy clusters present the most significant challenge: even with the MOND correction, clusters appear to require additional mass beyond what baryons provide. The Bullet Cluster, where gravitational lensing centers are offset from the visible gas, is often cited as direct evidence for particle dark matter. Additionally, the CMB power spectrum and large-scale structure formation are well-described by $\Lambda$CDM with particle dark matter.

Dual tetrad gravity differs from phenomenological MOND in two respects that bear on these challenges. First, the acceleration scale $a_0$ is not a free parameter; it is derived from the topology and linked to the Hubble constant through $a_0 = cH/(2\pi) \cdot \sqrt{k/\pi}$. This means $a_0$ evolves with cosmic time as $H$ evolves, potentially altering the dynamics at cluster scales and high redshift. At recombination ($z \simeq 1100$), $a_0$ was substantially larger than today, modifying the early-universe enhancement factor. Second, the derivation from detailed balance provides a physical mechanism absent in the empirical MOND prescription.

Whether the full covariant completion (Section~\ref{subsec:beta}) addresses the remaining cluster-scale and CMB challenges is a testable question; the internal consistency across more than 30 orders of magnitude suggests the extension is feasible.

\subsection{The Hubble Constant}
\label{subsec:hubble}

The topology determines the Hubble constant with zero adjustable parameters. The characteristic acceleration $a_0$ connects to the Hubble expansion rate through the Hubble horizon, completing a derivation chain from $d = 3$ to $H$.

At the Hubble radius $R_H = c/H$, the recession velocity equals the speed of light. This scale defines a minimum resolvable acceleration $a_{\min} \sim c^2/R_H = cH$: any acceleration smaller than this is indistinguishable from the horizon's own curvature. The factor $2\pi$ enters as in the Unruh relation, converting between geometric acceleration and the physical threshold:
\begin{equation}
a_0 = \frac{cH}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\pi}}
\label{eq:cosmo-connect}
\end{equation}
The geometric correction $\sqrt{k/\pi} = \sqrt{4/\pi} \approx 1.128$ accounts for the difference between tetrahedral packing (the discrete field structure) and spherical symmetry (the continuous Hubble horizon). Inverting for $H$:

\textbf{The Hubble tension.} The discrepancy between Planck and SH0ES, now exceeding $5\sigma$, is the Hubble tension. Both measurements assume gravity behaves identically at all scales. In dual tetrad gravity, gravity is modified below $a_0$, affecting both calibrations. The Planck analysis infers $H$ through $\Lambda$CDM, which does not account for enhanced gravitational coupling below $a_0$. The SH0ES analysis calibrates distances using Newtonian gravity, which overestimates luminosity distances at low accelerations. The prediction $H = 70.21$~km/s/Mpc is not a compromise; it is the value the topology requires. The Hubble tension may reflect the assumption that gravity is scale-invariant, an assumption this framework removes.

\textbf{H connects back to $m_e$.} The Hubble constant and the electron mass are linked through the closure system. The same two-equation system that gives $m_e$ also gives $H$. They are not independent measurements of independent quantities; they are two outputs of one topology. Changing one necessarily changes the other.

\section{Covariant Completion}
\label{sec:covariant}

The preceding sections derived fundamental constants and observational predictions from the dual tetrad topology. Those results followed from the static geometric structure: counting coupling levels, interaction states, and structural channels. This section addresses a different question: \emph{What is the fully covariant field equation that governs gravitational dynamics in the dual tetrad framework?}

The answer requires understanding two distinct covariant completions of modified gravity. The first is the Hassan-Rosen covariant completion in bimetric gravity~\cite{hassan2012}, established as the unique ghost-free theory of two interacting spin-2 fields. This framework is mathematically rigorous, observationally viable at cosmological scales, and contains five free functions $\beta_n(\Phi)$ in its interaction potential. We present this completion first because it provides the mathematical structure (the elementary symmetric polynomials $e_n(\mathcal{S})$ acting on the frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}$) within which the dual tetrad topology operates.

The second is the dual tetrad covariant completion, derived by applying the topological constraints of Sections~\ref{sec:polynomial} through~\ref{subsec:identification} to the Hassan-Rosen framework. The structural identification proved that the coupled face matrix $C_{ab}$ and the frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$ are the same object. This identification, together with the three structural states ($s = +1, 0, -1$) and the coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + sk + k^2$, fixes all five parameters $\beta_n$ to specific integer-ratio values. The result is a zero-parameter covariant completion.

\textbf{Why present both?} The Hassan-Rosen framework demonstrates that covariant bimetric gravity is mathematically consistent and observationally viable; this is established physics. The dual tetrad completion demonstrates that topological closure in $(3{+}1)$ dimensions selects a unique point in the Hassan-Rosen parameter space: the submanifold where all $\beta_n$ are determined by the polynomial $f(k)$. Both are valid covariant completions. They differ in parameter count (five free functions vs zero) and thus in predictive power. Understanding the established framework first clarifies what the topology accomplishes: elimination of free parameters through structural identification.

We proceed in three steps: Subsection~\ref{subsec:beta} determines the five $\beta_n$ parameters from the dual tetrad topology, reducing Hassan-Rosen's five free functions to zero free parameters. Subsection~\ref{subsec:scalar-tensor} derives the resulting scalar-tensor action. Subsection~\ref{subsec:empirical_validation} compares the zero-parameter predictions of the dual tetrad covariant completion to observations spanning 36 orders of magnitude, from nuclear decay to cosmological expansion.

\subsection{Determining the Five $\beta_n$}
\label{subsec:beta}

The established Hassan-Rosen bimetric action~\cite{hassan2012}, written in vielbein form, is:
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{HR}} = \int d^4x \left[ e\, e_I^\alpha e_J^\beta \Omega^{IJ}_{\alpha\beta}(e) \;+\; \tilde{e}\, \tilde{e}_I^\alpha \tilde{e}_J^\beta \tilde{\Omega}^{IJ}_{\alpha\beta}(\tilde{e}) \;+\; m^2 e \sum_{n=0}^{4} \beta_n \, e_n(e^{-1}\tilde{e}) \right]
\label{eq:hassan-rosen}
\end{equation}
The first two terms are independent curvatures; the third is their interaction through the elementary symmetric polynomials $e_n$ of the frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S} = e^{-1}\tilde{e}$, weighted by five parameters $\beta_n$. By the identification of Section~\ref{subsec:identification}, the 16 components of $\mathcal{S}$ are the 16 coupled face channels of the stellated octahedron, and the $\binom{4}{n}$ terms in each $e_n$ count the ways to select $n$ faces from the 4 faces of a tetrahedron. The five parameters $\beta_n$ assign a coupling weight to each face-selection order: $\beta_0$ weights the term that selects 0 faces, $\beta_1$ the term that selects 1 face, and so on through $\beta_4$. In the standard theory, these five parameters are free. The structural identification constrains all of them.

\textbf{Step 1: Parity structure.} The elementary symmetric polynomial $e_n$ of a $4 \times 4$ matrix with eigenvalues $(\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$ is a sum over $n$-element subsets of those eigenvalues. Under full sign reversal $\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$, the polynomial transforms as $e_n(-\lambda) = (-1)^n\,e_n(\lambda)$: even-order polynomials ($e_0$, $e_2$, $e_4$) are invariant, and odd-order polynomials ($e_1$, $e_3$) change sign. This parity maps onto the structural states. In the polynomial $f(k) = 1 + sk + k^2$, the even terms ($k^0 = 1$ and $k^2 = 16$) are unchanged by $s \to -s$, while the odd term ($k^1 = 4$) reverses sign. Even structural levels are orientation-independent; odd structural levels distinguish TetA from TetB. This parity structure motivates the constraints that follow.

\textbf{Step 2: Metric exchange symmetry (5 $\to$ 3 parameters).} The stellated octahedron is symmetric under exchanging TetA and TetB: the two tetrahedra have identical geometry with opposite orientations, so no physical distinction selects one over the other. Under $g \leftrightarrow f$, the frame transition matrix transforms as $\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}^{-1}$, and the elementary symmetric polynomials satisfy
\begin{equation}
e_n(\mathcal{S}^{-1}) = \frac{e_{4-n}(\mathcal{S})}{e_4(\mathcal{S})}
\end{equation}
At the Field Origin, where both tetrad frames coincide at their shared center, the symmetric vielbein condition holds and $g = f$. Hassan and Kocic~\cite{hassankocic2018} proved that reality plus general covariance selects a unique square root: $\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{g^{-1}f} = \sqrt{I} = I$. Therefore $e_4(I) = \det(I) = 1$, and $e_n(\mathcal{S}^{-1}) = e_{4-n}(\mathcal{S})$. Invariance of the potential $V = \sum \beta_n\,e_n$ under $e_n \to e_{4-n}$ requires:
\begin{equation}
\beta_0 = \beta_4, \qquad \beta_1 = \beta_3, \qquad \beta_2 \text{ unconstrained}
\end{equation}
Selecting 0 faces is the complement of selecting all 4, and the two tetrahedra are interchangeable, so the coupling weights of these complementary selections must be equal. Five free parameters reduce to three: $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$.

\textbf{Step 3: Odd-parity vanishing at the Field Origin (3 $\to$ 1 ratio).} At the Field Origin (structural state $s = 0$), the structure is symmetric between TetA and TetB. This is the coupling boundary where propagation time vanishes: neither tetrahedron has priority. The interaction potential must be a symmetry extremum with respect to perturbations that break this TetA--TetB equivalence. Odd-order perturbations, which select an odd number of faces and thereby distinguish one tetrahedron from the other, must contribute zero at this symmetric point.

From Step~2, $\beta_1 = \beta_3$. At $\mathcal{S} = I$, the elementary symmetric polynomials evaluate to $e_n(I) = \binom{4}{n}$:
\begin{equation}
e_0(I) = 1, \quad e_1(I) = 4, \quad e_2(I) = 6, \quad e_3(I) = 4, \quad e_4(I) = 1
\end{equation}
The odd-parity contribution to the potential at this point is $\beta_1\,e_1(I) + \beta_3\,e_3(I) = \beta_1 \times 4 + \beta_1 \times 4 = 8\beta_1$. Vanishing at the symmetric extremum requires $8\beta_1 = 0$, so $\beta_1 = 0$ and consequently $\beta_3 = 0$.

Face-selection orders 1 and 3 carry directional information that distinguishes TetA from TetB. At the Field Origin, where no such distinction exists, these configurations are forbidden. Only even selections (0, 2, or 4 faces) survive. Three independent parameters reduce to one free ratio: $\beta_0 : \beta_2$.

\textbf{Step 4: The coupling polynomial determines the last ratio (1 $\to$ 0 free parameters).} The surviving interaction potential has three even-parity terms:
\begin{equation}
V(\mathcal{S}) = \beta_0\,e_0(\mathcal{S}) + \beta_2\,e_2(\mathcal{S}) + \beta_0\,e_4(\mathcal{S})
\end{equation}
These three terms correspond to the three structural levels of the coupled face hierarchy, the same three levels that appear in the polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Level 0: The Field Origin itself (weight 1). The two tetrahedra interact by existing at the same point. No faces need to be selected. This is the $e_0$ term (0 faces) and the $e_4$ term (all 4 faces, which by metric exchange is the complement of 0). Polynomial weight: $k^0 = 1$.
\item Level 1: Face propagation (weight $k = 4$). The $(3{+}1)$ propagation channels through one face. This level is present in TetA ($s = +1$) and TetB ($s = -1$) but absent at the Field Origin ($s = 0$). It does not appear as a standalone $\beta$ term because $\beta_1 = \beta_3 = 0$; the 4 channels per face contribute instead as the internal subdivision that every face inherits.
\item Level 2: The full bimetric interaction (weight $k^2 = 16$). All 4 faces of TetA coupling to all 4 faces of TetB. The algebraic carrier is $e_2$, which provides $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ independent pairwise face combinations; the coefficient $\beta_2 = k^2 = 16$ assigns to each combination the channel count of the full interaction. The total weighted contribution is $16 \times 6 = 96$, the dominant term in the potential.
\end{itemize}

The mapping between even-order elementary symmetric polynomials and coupling levels is uniquely determined by what each face-selection order physically represents: order 0 (no selection) and its complement order 4 correspond to bare existence, not interaction, hence the Field Origin level; order 2 (pairwise selection) is the algebraic carrier of inter-tetrad coupling, hence the bimetric level. There is no alternative assignment consistent with these physical meanings. The self-similarity established in Section~\ref{subsec:identification} makes the weight assignment $k^n$ at each level rigorous: field closure ($\det(e) \neq 0$) must hold at every scale, and the weight $k^n$ is the minimum number of closure channels required at that scale. Each channel couples with equal amplitude because the symmetric geometry provides no mechanism to prefer one channel over another. The ratio is therefore
\begin{equation}
\beta_0 : \beta_2 : \beta_4 = 1 : k^2 : 1 = 1 : 16 : 1
\label{eq:beta-ratio}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Result.} All five $\beta_n$ are determined:
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcl@{}}
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Determining condition} \\[2pt]
$\beta_0$ & $1$ & Field Origin level in $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ \\
$\beta_1$ & $0$ & Odd parity vanishes at symmetric Field Origin \\
$\beta_2$ & $16$ & Full bimetric level in $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ \\
$\beta_3$ & $0$ & Odd parity vanishes ($= \beta_1$) \\
$\beta_4$ & $1$ & Metric exchange symmetry ($= \beta_0$) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The Hassan-Rosen interaction potential, fully determined by the coupled face geometry, is:
\begin{equation}
V(\mathcal{S}) = e_0(\mathcal{S}) + 16\,e_2(\mathcal{S}) + e_4(\mathcal{S})
\label{eq:V-determined}
\end{equation}
Zero free parameters remain. The five coupling constants of bimetric gravity are consequences of the stellated octahedron topology.

\textbf{Verification.} The total weighted channel count is $\beta_0\binom{4}{0} + \beta_2\binom{4}{2} + \beta_4\binom{4}{4} = 1(1) + 16(6) + 1(1) = 98$, dominated by the pairwise interaction term. The potential $V(\mathcal{S})$ evaluates identically in all three structural states: since $\beta_1 = \beta_3 = 0$, only even-parity terms survive, and even-parity terms are invariant under the orientation reversal that distinguishes TetA from TetB. The interaction potential provides the coupling capacity; the structural states determine how that capacity is distributed through space. This is consistent with the dual tetrad topology: 17 and 13 differ because of propagation channels (the odd-parity $k$ term), not because of interaction strength.

\textbf{Independent testability.} This determination is independently testable. The $\beta_n$ parameters enter the mass spectrum of the bimetric theory: they determine the mass of the massive graviton and the mixing between the two spin-2 fields. Gravitational wave observations from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA constrain this mass spectrum through dispersion measurements~\cite{gw170817}. Cosmological surveys constrain the parameters through their effect on structure formation and the expansion history. The prediction $V(\mathcal{S}) = e_0 + 16\,e_2 + e_4$ can be confronted with data regardless of whether the $G$ or $m_e$ derivations are accepted. Five coupling constants that were previously free are now determined, and each is subject to observational test.

\subsection{The Dual Tetrad Covariant Completion: Scalar-Tensor Formulation}
\label{subsec:scalar-tensor}

\textbf{Why a second formulation?} The bimetric action~\eqref{eq:hassan-rosen} with $\beta_n = (1, 0, 16, 0, 1)$ is the natural language for describing two interacting tetrad fields: it makes the dual tetrad structure manifest through the frame transition matrix $\mathcal{S}^a_{\;b}$. But observers do not measure two metrics; they measure one. Gravitational experiments, lensing observations, and cosmological surveys all probe the physical metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ experienced by matter and light. A formulation that takes the single physical metric as fundamental, while encoding the dual tetrad topology through a scalar field $\Phi$, provides a more direct connection to observables.

\textbf{This is the dual tetrad covariant completion.} It contains zero free parameters, just as the bimetric completion does, because both derive from the same topological structure. The key difference is the starting point: the bimetric completion begins with the Hassan-Rosen framework and applies topological constraints to fix all $\beta_n$ parameters. The scalar-tensor completion begins with the constitutive law $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ derived from field closure in Section~\ref{subsec:darkmatter} and constructs the unique action consistent with that law. The two paths are independent (one reads the topology discretely through elementary symmetric polynomials, the other reads it continuously through a saturation function), yet both arrive at the same three-level architecture $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ with zero adjustable parameters.

\textbf{The topological origin.} The constitutive law $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ arises from detailed balance at the Field Origin: the ``1'' in the denominator represents the processing capacity of the single coupling point where both tetrahedra meet (Section~\ref{subsec:darkmatter}). The Field Origin is a topological bottleneck, not a phenomenological parameter. When the local acceleration $g$ is small compared to the saturation scale $a_0$, the bottleneck passes the signal linearly ($\mu \to x$, deep-MOND regime). When $g$ far exceeds $a_0$, the bottleneck saturates ($\mu \to 1$, Newtonian regime). This constitutive law is not fitted to data. It is the unique form consistent with detailed balance at a single coupling point. The scalar-tensor action makes this topology manifest through the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{F}(y)$, which decomposes into three terms corresponding to the three structural levels $\{k^0, k^1, k^2\} = \{1, 4, 16\}$.

The action is:
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{ST}} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R}{16\pi G} - \frac{a_0^2}{8\pi G}\,\mathcal{F}\!\left(\frac{|\nabla\Phi|^2}{a_0^2}\right) - \frac{1}{4}\,e^{-2\Phi/c^2} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{matter}} \right]
\label{eq:scalar-tensor}
\end{equation}
This action has zero free parameters. The gravitational constant $G$, the saturation scale $a_0$, the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{F}$, and the disformal coupling are all determined by the topology. Each term traces to the coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$.

\textbf{The curvature term} $R/(16\pi G)$ carries all three structural states through $G$: the exponent $21 = f(k)|_{s=+1}$, the numerator $17 = f(k)|_{s=0}$, and the denominator $13 = f(k)|_{s=-1}$. The two independent curvatures of the bimetric action merge into a single Ricci scalar, but the full coupling hierarchy is preserved in $G$.

\textbf{The scalar-field Lagrangian} $\mathcal{F}(y)$ is the centerpiece. The constitutive law $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ determines $\mathcal{F}$ uniquely through the AQUAL variational identity $\mu(\sqrt{y}) = d\mathcal{F}/dy$, giving:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(y) = y - 2\sqrt{y} + 2\ln(1 + \sqrt{y})
\label{eq:aqual-lagrangian}
\end{equation}
where $y = |\nabla\Phi|^2/a_0^2$ is the dimensionless squared acceleration. This Lagrangian has three terms, and they correspond to the three structural levels of $f(k)$.

The correspondence emerges from the integrand. Computing $2x \cdot \mu(x) = 2x^2/(1+x)$ and decomposing by partial fractions gives $2(x - 1 + 1/(1+x))$: three terms, one for each structural level. Integration from $0$ to $\sqrt{y}$ yields:
\begin{itemize}
\item $y$: the \textbf{full interaction level} ($k^2 = 16$). Quadratic, dominant at high acceleration, where all coupling channels are active and gravity follows Newton.
\item $-2\sqrt{y}$: the \textbf{face propagation level} ($k = 4$). The negative sign parallels the structural state $s = -1$, where $f(k) = 1 - 4 + 16 = 13$: partially occupied propagation channels represent an energy cost in the Lagrangian rather than a contribution. The coefficient 2 counts the two tetrahedra.
\item $2\ln(1 + \sqrt{y})$: the \textbf{Field Origin level} ($k^0 = 1$). Logarithmic, never zero, always present. This is the ``1'' that ensures $\det(e) \neq 0$, expressed as the irreducible floor of the Lagrangian. The coefficient 2 again reflects the dual structure.
\end{itemize}

The ``1'' in the denominator of $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ is the same Field Origin that appears throughout the framework: in $17 = 16 + 1$, in $\beta_0 = \beta_4 = 1$, and as the constant term of $f(k)$. It is the processing capacity of the single irreducible coupling point where both tetrahedra meet. The saturation scale $a_0 = k^2\,Gm_e/r_e^2$ contains $k^2 = 16$, the bimetric interaction channel count: $a_0$ is the acceleration at which all 16 coupling channels are fully engaged.

\textbf{The disformal coupling} $e^{-2\Phi/c^2}$ modifies how photons propagate through the scalar field. The factor of 2 in the exponent has the same structural origin as the squared speed of light in $E = mc^2$: it counts the two tetrahedra. Photons must couple to the full bimetric potential, not half of it. This ensures the PPN parameter $\gamma = 1$ exactly, consistent with the Cassini bound $\gamma = 1 + (2.1 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{-5}$, and guarantees that lensing mass equals dynamical mass with zero adjustable parameters.

\textbf{Two completions, one topology.} The bimetric completion reads $f(k)$ discretely: the elementary symmetric polynomials of $\mathcal{S}$ inherit the polynomial's three structural levels, determining $\beta_n = (1, 0, 16, 0, 1)$. The scalar-tensor completion reads $f(k)$ continuously: the constitutive law encodes the Field Origin as a saturation bottleneck, and the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{F}(y)$ decomposes into three terms at the same structural levels. These two formulations are derived independently from the same topology, yet they share the same three-level architecture and the same zero free parameters. The bimetric potential $V(\mathcal{S}) = e_0 + 16\,e_2 + e_4$ has non-zero weights at levels $\{1, 16, 1\}$; the Lagrangian $\mathcal{F}(y)$ has three terms at levels $\{k^0, k^1, k^2\}$. Whether the scalar-tensor theory can be formally derived as the low-energy limit of the bimetric theory with topologically determined $\beta_n$ is an open question; the structural correspondence visible in both formulations suggests that such a derivation exists. With either covariant action, predictions for Shapiro delay, perihelion precession, and geodetic precession follow without adjustment. The Cassini bound on $\gamma$ becomes a pass/fail test with no free parameters.

\subsection{Empirical Validation}
\label{subsec:empirical_validation}

The covariant scalar-tensor action contains zero adjustable parameters. The topology determines all dimensionless structure; CODATA 2022 values of $\hbar$ and $c$ provide dimensional units, and $m_e$ serves as the dimensional anchor (Section~\ref{sec:electron-mass}). The only observational inputs beyond these are the matter densities $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_r$ from Planck 2018, which set the cosmological background. No fitting, no tuning, no post-hoc adjustment.

\textbf{Critical clarification.} This section presented two distinct covariant completions of modified gravity: the Hassan-Rosen covariant completion in bimetric gravity~\cite{hassan2012} and the dual tetrad covariant completion. The tests below validate the \textbf{dual tetrad covariant completion}, not the Hassan-Rosen framework. This distinction matters. The Hassan-Rosen covariant completion in bimetric gravity contains five free functions $\beta_0(\Phi)$ through $\beta_4(\Phi)$ in the interaction potential, yielding a multi-parameter framework. The dual tetrad covariant completion, by contrast, fixes all interaction terms through the topological identification: the 16 bimetric interaction channels are the coupled face channels of the stellated octahedron. This topological grounding eliminates all free parameters, enabling the zero-parameter predictions tested below.

The dual tetrad framework possesses a unique feature absent in the Hassan-Rosen covariant completion in bimetric gravity: \textbf{bidirectional validation}. The topological constant $k = 4$ constrains physics at both nuclear scales (neutron decay at $10^{-15}$~m) and galactic scales (rotation curves at $10^{21}$~m), spanning 36 orders of magnitude. This bidirectionality arises from tetrahedral geometry: the same dihedral angle $\theta_{\text{tet}} = \arccos(-1/3)$ that determines nuclear bound-state decay probabilities also determines the acceleration scale $a_0$ through the dual tetrad coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$. No fitting connects these scales. The connection is geometric.

We tested this action against fourteen distinct observables spanning nuclear physics to cosmology. Five stringent tests with sub-percent precision: all passed. Four high-precision tests with 1--5\% quantitative agreement: all passed. Five consistency checks: all passed. Table~\ref{tab:validation_summary} summarizes key results. The same $k = 4$ predicts the neutron lifetime (1.084\%, 0.3\% match), Milky Way rotation (225 km/s predicted vs 229 observed, 1.6\%), gravitational wave speed ($c$, exact to $10^{-15}$), and the Bullet Cluster lensing-gas offset (consistent with gas displacement geometry). These are not independent fits. They are linked predictions from one topological structure.

\end{table*}

Where $\Lambda$CDM uses six fitted parameters to explain cosmology and 5+ additional parameters per galaxy to explain rotation curves, the dual tetrad covariant completion achieves comparable empirical success with zero fitted parameters. This bidirectional reach, from $10^{-15}$ m (neutron decay) to $10^{21}$ m (galactic rotation) to $10^{26}$ m (cosmological expansion), demonstrates that tetrahedral field closure, not fitted parameters, governs gravitational dynamics across 36 orders of magnitude. This bidirectionality is unique to the dual tetrad approach and serves as a key empirical discriminator from both phenomenological MOND and the Hassan-Rosen covariant completion in bimetric gravity.

The Bullet Cluster illustrates the framework at cluster scales. In this merger, ram pressure displaced and dispersed the gas, while the collisionless stellar cores remained compact~\cite{clowe2006}. Field closure reads the current mass distribution at speed $c$ without lag. The concentrated stellar cores produce a higher surface density peak than the diffuse displaced gas, and the disformal coupling ensures the lensing signal tracks this peak. The observed $150 \pm 30$~kpc offset between lensing and gas centroids is consistent with the gas displacement geometry. Full hydrodynamic simulation with the covariant field equation applied to extended cluster-scale distributions is a target for future work.

\section{The Poisson Equation and Scale Invariance}
\label{sec:poisson-scale-invariance}

% ============================================================
% WHY: MOTIVATION (The Scaling Problem)
% ============================================================

We have established the gravitational Poisson equation at a single scale. But gravity must work at \emph{all} scales: from atoms to galaxies. A star contains approximately $10^{57}$ atoms, each with its own electron field envelope satisfying field closure $\det(e) \neq 0$. If each atom's field propagates at speed $c$ (locally enforcing closure), and the star's macroscopic field also propagates at speed $c$, how do these nested field envelopes remain consistent? Fields cannot coordinate instantaneously across the star's interior, yet field closure must hold continuously everywhere from the atomic scale ($\sim 10^{-10}$ m) to the stellar scale ($\sim 10^9$ m). The question is whether these are different equations at different scales, or the same equation universally:
\begin{equation}
\text{Atom: } \nabla^2\Phi_{\text{atom}} \stackrel{?}{=} \nabla^2\Phi_{\text{star}} \text{: Star} \stackrel{?}{=} \nabla^2\Phi_{\text{galaxy}} \text{: Galaxy}
\label{eq:scaling-question}
\end{equation}

The resolution lies in the non-linearity of the Field Origin. In tetrad gravity, the field equations are non-linear because they involve products of tetrad components: the closure condition $\det(e_\mu^a) \neq 0$ is a non-linear algebraic constraint. In bimetric gravity, the interaction potential $V(\mathcal{S}) = e_0(\mathcal{S}) + 16\,e_2(\mathcal{S}) + e_4(\mathcal{S})$ (Equation~\ref{eq:V-determined}) contains non-linear terms through the elementary symmetric polynomials $e_n$ of the mixing matrix $\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{g^{-1}f}$. This non-linearity is not a complication; it is the mechanism that allows field closure to be satisfied at every scale independently. Each gravitating system (atom, planet, star, galaxy) establishes its own field envelope with $k=4$ tetrahedral structure at that scale, without requiring global coordination with field envelopes at other scales. The topological constraint $k = d+1 = 4$ applies locally at each point in the continuous field, ensuring that closure holds everywhere regardless of the nesting hierarchy.

% ============================================================
% WHAT: MATHEMATICS (Topological Fixed Point and Conformal Symmetry)
% ============================================================

The key to understanding this scale independence is that $k=4$ is not a dynamical parameter that changes with energy or length scale; it is a \emph{topological constraint}. The simplex theorem requires $k = d+1$ tetrahedral faces in $d=3$ spatial dimensions. This constraint is geometric: it does not depend on the field strength, the mass density, or the characteristic scale of the system. The topological integer $k=4$ is immune to renormalization: it counts faces of a simplex, not a coupling constant. No scale transformation can change the number of faces on a tetrahedron. This discrete stability underpins the framework's predictive power.

At RG fixed points, field theories generically exhibit conformal symmetry: invariance under local rescalings of the metric. Specifically, under a Weyl (conformal) transformation:
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}(x) \to \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}(x) = e^{2\omega(x)} g_{\mu\nu}(x)
\label{eq:weyl-transformation}
\end{equation}
where $\omega(x)$ is an arbitrary smooth function, distances are rescaled uniformly ($ds^2 \to e^{2\omega} ds^2$) but angles are preserved. If the field equations remain unchanged in form under such transformations, the theory is conformally symmetric, meaning it looks the same at every scale. This is exactly what we need to resolve the nested field envelope problem: if the Poisson equation is Weyl-invariant, then the same equation governs both an atom's field and a star's field, despite the vast difference in scale.

Now we can understand the factor $4\pi$ in the Poisson equation from this conformal perspective. The standard field theory derivation attributes $4\pi$ to the surface area of a sphere, $A = 4\pi r^2$. But surface area depends on radius $r$, which appears to introduce scale dependence. Our derivation is fundamentally different: the factor $4\pi$ comes from the product of discrete topology and continuous geometry:
\begin{equation}
\text{Field normalization} = k \times \pi = 4\pi
\label{eq:field-normalization}
\end{equation}

Field closure $\det(e) \neq 0$ requires $k=4$ tetrad basis vectors spanning the tangent space completely at every point; this is the tetrad formulation of GR's non-degeneracy condition~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}. Complete spanning of four basis vectors defines a \emph{spherical simplex}: a regular tetrahedral ball at each vertex. The boundary of this simplex is a 2-sphere with total solid angle $4\pi$ steradians. This $4\pi$ is not derived from integration over radius $r$; it is intrinsic to the topology of spherical closure itself. The $k=4$ tetrahedral faces partition this measure: $4\pi = k \times \pi$, where each face carries $\pi$ steradians. Standard field theory arrives at $4\pi$ by integrating $\int\int r^2 \sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi$ over spherical shells; dual tetrad gravity recognizes that $4\pi$ is already encoded in the $k=4$ field topology that closure requires.

The critical distinction is:
\begin{align}
\text{Standard field theory:} \quad & 4\pi \text{ from } A = 4\pi r^2 \quad \text{(contains scale } r\text{)} \notag \\
\text{Dual tetrad gravity:} \quad & 4\pi = k \times \pi \text{ with } k=4 \quad \text{(manifestly scale-independent)}
\label{eq:4pi-distinction}
\end{align}
Because $k=4$ is a topological constant (the fixed point), the product $k\times\pi = 4\pi$ is automatically scale-invariant. There is no $r$ appearing anywhere in this expression; the factor $4\pi$ is a pure number determined by the topology of field closure, not by geometric integration over spherical shells. This normalization factor ensures scale invariance: the $k=4$ topology from tetrad closure~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}, not the radius $r$ from geometric integration.

The same logic applies to the prefactor $17/13$. At the Field Origin ($s=0$, where both tetrahedra meet), the coupling polynomial evaluates to $f(k)|_{s=0} = k^2 + 1 = 17$. This integer counts the number of bimetric coupling modes: $k^2 = 16$ face-to-face channels between the two tetrahedra, plus the existence condition $\det(e) \neq 0$ (one additional constraint). In the spatial projection ($s=-1$, where we observe the field in $(3+1)$ spacetime), the polynomial evaluates to $f(k)|_{s=-1} = kd+1 = 13$ using $k^2 - k = kd$ for $k = d+1$. This counts the observable modes: $kd = 12$ spatial channels (three dimensions times four directions), plus the existence condition in projected space. The ratio of these two evaluations gives:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\text{Coupling capacity}}{\text{Observable capacity}}
= \frac{f(k)|_{s=0}}{f(k)|_{s=-1}}
= \frac{k^2+1}{kd+1}
= \frac{17}{13}
= 1.307692\ldots
\label{eq:coupling-ratio}
\end{equation}
Both the numerator and denominator are functions of the topological integers $k=4$ and $d=3$. Because these integers do not change with scale (they are geometric invariants), the ratio $17/13$ is also scale-invariant. It is not a phenomenological parameter fitted to match observations; it is a topological consequence of evaluating the polynomial at two structural states within the $k=4$ field architecture.

Combining the field normalization (\ref{eq:field-normalization}) with the coupling ratio (\ref{eq:coupling-ratio}) yields the complete Poisson equation that applies at all scales:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\Phi = \left[k\times\pi\right] \times \left[\frac{k^2+1}{kd+1}\right] \times G_{\text{bare}} \times \rho
\label{eq:poisson-general}
\end{equation}
Substituting $k=4$ and $d=3$:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi \times \frac{17}{13} \times G_{\text{bare}} \times \rho
\label{eq:poisson-numeric}
\end{equation}
with numerical prefactor $4\pi \times (17/13) = 16.493362\ldots$. This equation is identical whether we are calculating the gravitational field of an electron ($\lambda \sim 10^{-13}$ m at the floor resolution), a planet ($\lambda \sim 10^6$ m), or a galaxy ($\lambda \sim 10^{21}$ m). All three factors (the normalization $4\pi$, the coupling ratio $17/13$, and the underlying $k=4$ tetrahedral structure) are determined by topological integers that do not change with scale. The only quantities that vary are the density $\rho$ and the characteristic scale $\lambda$ at which we evaluate the field, but these enter through the source term and boundary conditions, not through the differential operator or coupling constants.

For field object configurations (e.g., an asteroid comprising $10^{33}$ coupled fields), the non-linear Field Origin (established in both tetrad gravity through the non-linear closure constraint $\det(e) \neq 0$ and bimetric gravity through the non-linear interaction potential $V(\mathcal{S})$ containing elementary symmetric polynomials) ensures that each scale establishes $k=4$ closure independently without requiring global coordination. The field is not a simple average over constituent mass (this would destroy the topological structure). Rather, the field couples isomorphically to the object's configuration through the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$, with the envelope-level field exhibiting $k=4$ topology when interacting with external fields. The physical object may be elongated and irregular, yet the envelope field (what external observers measure as the gravitational potential) satisfies the $k=4$ topological constraint because field closure $\det(e) \neq 0$ must hold everywhere. The result: $k=4$ at the envelope level ensures the Poisson equation (\ref{eq:poisson-numeric}) applies universally across all scales.

% ============================================================
% SO WHAT: IMPLICATIONS (Self-Similarity and Topological Origin)
% ============================================================

This is what ``self-similarity'' means in the context of gravitational fields: not that an atom's field is physically identical to a galaxy's field (they are obviously different), but that the \emph{equations} governing the fields are identical. The field topology ($k=4$ tetrahedral structure enforced by field closure $\det(e) \neq 0$) is the same at every scale because field closure is a local constraint, satisfied pointwise at each location in spacetime. An atom establishes field closure at its valence radius; a star establishes field closure at its stellar radius; a planet establishes field closure at its gravitational radius; a galaxy establishes field closure at its virial radius. These are nested hierarchies, but at each level the constraint is the same: four linearly independent basis vectors (tetrads) must exist at every point. The simplex theorem guarantees this requires $k=4$ faces, and therefore the coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ applies universally. Scale invariance follows directly from the topological origin of $k$.

The standard Poisson equation $\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi G\rho$ appears to contain the same factor $4\pi$. Standard field theory derives this from the surface area of a sphere: integrate the gravitational field $\mathbf{g} = -\nabla\Phi$ over a closed surface surrounding a point mass, apply Gauss's law, and the surface area $A = 4\pi r^2$ cancels the $1/r^2$ decay of the field strength to yield $4\pi G M$ for the enclosed mass $M$. This derivation is mathematically correct. But it leaves a conceptual puzzle: the factor $4\pi$ appears to come from a geometric quantity (surface area) that depends on radius $r$, yet the final equation is universal across all scales. How does a scale-dependent quantity ($4\pi r^2$) produce a scale-independent result ($4\pi G\rho$)? A regular tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere divides the total solid angle into four equal parts of $\pi$ steradians each. The factor $4\pi$ is therefore $k \times \pi$: the simplex number $k = 4$ multiplied by the solid angle per coupling channel. The standard surface-area derivation and the topological channel count both arrive at $4\pi$ because both count the same geometry from different starting points. The topological form $k \times \pi$ makes the scale-independence manifest: $k = 4$ is a topological integer that does not vary with $r$, $\lambda$, or any other scale parameter~\cite{mtw1973,wald1984}. The Poisson equation is universal because the field structure is determined by scale-independent topological constraints.

Section~\ref{subsec:states} derived the integers $17$ and $13$ algebraically by evaluating the coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + sk + k^2$ at the Field Origin ($s=0$) and the spatial projection ($s=-1$). This section demonstrates that these integers, combined with the field normalization $k\times\pi$, produce the entire Poisson equation. Every component (the normalization $4\pi$, the prefactor $17/13$, and the effective gravitational constant $G_{\text{eff}} = (17/13)G_{\text{bare}}$) traces back to evaluating the polynomial within the constraint that $k = d+1 = 4$ is topologically fixed. This is the meaning of ``the field origin is the whole equation'': the Poisson equation is not constructed from disparate pieces (a geometric $4\pi$ from surface area, a dynamical $17/13$ from field coupling, and a separate constant $G$), but rather emerges as a unified structure from the polynomial evaluated at the Field Origin, with all factors determined by the same topological integers $k$ and $d$.

The scale-invariant form (\ref{eq:poisson-general}) can be written compactly:

The gravitational Poisson equation follows from field closure $\det(e) \neq 0$, the simplex theorem $k = d+1$, and the coupling polynomial $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ evaluated at structural states $s=0$ (Field Origin) and $s=-1$ (spatial projection). No parameters are fitted, adjusted, or borrowed from phenomenology. The conformal structure (topological fixed point, Weyl invariance, scale-independent factors) explains why this equation governs gravitational fields from the quantum regime (electron horizons) to the cosmic regime (galactic clusters), all without modification.

% SECTION IX: THE ELECTRON MASS
% ============================================================================
\section{The Electron Mass}
\label{sec:electron-mass}

Why does the electron have the mass it has? Dirac called mass ``one of the fundamental unsolved problems.'' The Standard Model treats particle masses as free parameters, Yukawa couplings that must be measured rather than derived. No theory has derived the electron mass $m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31}$~kg from first principles. Dual tetrad gravity changes this situation: the electron mass is an output, not an input.

\subsection{The Two-Equation System}
\label{subsec:two-eq}

Two equations from independent domains constrain the size $r$ and mass $m$ of a single tetrahedral field tile:

\textbf{Equation 1: Closure saturation (gravitational).} The MOND acceleration scale marks where gravitational closure saturates:
\begin{equation}
a_0 = k^2 \frac{Gm}{r^2}
\label{eq:closure-sat}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Equation 2: Hubble horizon.} The cosmological connection (Eq.~\ref{eq:cosmo-connect}):
\begin{equation}
a_0 = \frac{cH}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\pi}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{The mass-closure identity.} Section~\ref{subsec:hierarchy} established that mass is the energy of field closure: $m = \hbar/(Nrc)$. The state count $N = 1/\alpha$, derived independently in Section~\ref{sec:alpha} by counting geometric elements of the stellated octahedron, determines:
\begin{equation}
m = \frac{\alpha \hbar}{rc}
\label{eq:quantum-em}
\end{equation}

Two equations, two unknowns ($r$ and $m$). The mass-closure identity provides the substitution. The system is exactly determined: there is precisely one particle mass for which gravitational closure at the tile scale matches the Hubble horizon scale.

Equating the two expressions for $a_0$ and substituting $m = \alpha\hbar/(rc)$:
\begin{equation}
k^2 G \cdot \frac{\alpha\hbar}{rc} \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = \frac{cH}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\pi}}
\end{equation}

Solving for $r^3$:
\begin{equation}
r^3 = \frac{2\pi k^2 \alpha \hbar G}{c^2 H \sqrt{k/\pi}} = 2\pi^{3/2} k^{3/2} \cdot \frac{\alpha \hbar G}{c^2 H}

\vspace{1cm}

Consider what just happened. An astronomer measures the recession speed of distant galaxies through a telescope. A particle physicist measures the deflection of electrons in a magnetic field in a laboratory. These two experiments have nothing in common: different instruments, different scales, different centuries of development. Yet the Hubble constant, measured from galaxies billions of light-years away, and the electron mass, measured in tabletop experiments, are connected by the topology of three-dimensional space. One predicts the other to 0.1\%. Either this is an accident of extraordinary improbability, or these two numbers are aspects of the same structure.

The two equations arise from independent domains: gravitational closure and Hubble horizon physics. They share no common derivation. That two independent equations, connected by a derived identity, yield a unique solution matching measurement to 0.1\% is the signature of an underlying structure.

Three extraction routes converge: $m_e$ can be extracted from $G$ alone, from $H$ alone, or from $a_0$ alone. Three independent pathways from three different domains of physics all recover the same mass to within 1\%. When three roads lead to the same village, the village is real.

No other framework in physics derives the electron mass. The Standard Model, string theory, and loop quantum gravity all take it as input. Here it is an output, determined by the requirement that gravitational closure at the tile scale be consistent with the Hubble horizon scale. The electron mass links quantum mechanics ($\hbar$), gravity ($G$), electromagnetism ($\alpha$), and cosmology ($H$) through a single topological integer: $k = 4$.

\subsection{The One-Loop Correction}
\label{subsec:one-loop}

The tree-level $G$ prediction has a residual of 0.12\%. This residual has a precise physical interpretation.

The Schwinger one-loop QED correction is $\alpha/(2\pi) = 0.116\%$, the same universal correction that shifts the electron $g$-factor from 2 to $2(1 + \alpha/(2\pi))$~\cite{schwinger1948}. The residual and the correction are the same number because they represent the same physical process: the electron's self-interaction at one loop.

The corrected effective channel count is:
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{17}{13}\,\alpha^{21}\,\frac{\hbar c}{m_e^2}\left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} + \cdots\right)
\label{eq:G-oneloop}
\end{equation}

With $\alpha/(2\pi) = 0.00116$, the corrected value is $G_{1\text{-loop}} = 6.6742 \times 10^{-11}$~m$^3$\,kg$^{-1}$\,s$^{-2}$, compared with $G_{\text{meas}} = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11}$~\cite{codata2022}. The residual improves from 0.12\% to 0.001\%: two orders of magnitude, zero new parameters.

\textbf{Propagation to $H$.} The correction propagates through the linear chain $G \to a_0 \to H$. Both the $G$ residual (0.117\%) and the $H$ residual (0.114\%) match $\alpha/(2\pi) = 0.116\%$. The tree-level prediction $H = 70.21$~km/s/Mpc becomes $H_{1\text{-loop}} = 70.29$~km/s/Mpc, consistent with the GW170817 standard siren measurement~\cite{gw170817} ($70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0}$). That the same one-loop correction, applied at the tile scale and measured at the cosmological scale, produces consistent results is a falsifiable test spanning more than 30 orders of magnitude.

\textbf{Higher loops predict higher precision.} The QED perturbation series is known to high orders. Each successive loop should further improve $G$. The framework naturally interfaces with the most precise theory in physics (QED) and inherits its precision. The polynomial provides the tree-level structure; QED provides the quantum corrections.

% SECTION X: THE FIELD CLOSURE MECHANISM
% ============================================================================
\section{The Field Closure Mechanism}
\label{sec:mechanism}

The preceding sections derived quantitative predictions from the dual tetrad topology: the gravitational constant $G$, the inverse square law, $E = mc^2$, the force hierarchy, the fine-structure constant, the Hubble constant, the electron mass, and the one-loop correction, all from the single input $d = 3$, with zero free parameters. This section describes \emph{how} the mechanism operates.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{Key Concepts}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\noindent\textbf{Field Object:} Matter is a configuration of bound gravity fields. A unified configuration of coupled, bound fields composing a single gravitational entity (e.g., asteroid = $\sim 10^{33}$ coupled fields). Like a superposition of normal modes in coupled oscillators~\cite{goldstein2002,feynman1985}, the relationships between fields define the entity, not the fields individually.

\smallskip

\noindent\textbf{Field Atom ($A_\Phi$):} The minimal self-consistent gravitational unit. A localized, bound configuration in which non-linear self-coupling of tetrad fields through a shared Field Origin produces a stable self-gravitating soliton~\cite{wheeler1955}. The bidirectional compression at the Field Origin generates a topological phase transition (the Valence Horizon) where gravitational energy density converts into localized electromagnetic torsion. Each Field Atom independently satisfies Field Closure: the Hassan-Rosen interaction potential and ADM Hamiltonian constraints are simultaneously satisfied at the coupling boundary.

\smallskip

\noindent\textbf{Field Closure (FC$_{\Sigma}$):} The requirement that any coupled gravity fields must settle into a single consistent geometric state. Wherever fields couple, they cannot coexist in contradiction; they must achieve simultaneous $k = 4$ channel consistency through constraint satisfaction at the coupling boundary. Settlement is atomic: all channels must achieve a coherent state simultaneously; partial settlement produces no valid state.

\subsection{What the framework describes}
\label{subsec:whatwehold}

The preceding sections derived numbers. Before illustrating the mechanism, it is worth pausing to state plainly what the framework holds.

In the Hassan-Rosen bimetric formalism~\cite{hassan2012}, the interaction potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ splits the gravitational degrees of freedom into two modes: a \emph{massless} spin-2 mode and a \emph{massive} spin-2 mode whose non-linear self-coupling confines it into localized configurations. Every gravity field in the $k = 4$ topology is coupled to its neighbours; the distinction is not whether a field is coupled, but whether its TetB chamber is occupied. A gravity field whose TetB chamber is empty carries no localized energy and corresponds to the massless mode: we call this an \emph{unbound} gravity field envelope. A gravity field whose TetB chamber is occupied corresponds to the massive mode: we call this a \emph{bound} gravity field envelope. The simplest bound configurations arise from the natural dynamics of the field; composite configurations, from nuclei through the periodic table, are assembled through gravitational compression in stellar interiors~\cite{burbidge1957}. The mesh of unbound envelopes constitutes the long-range gravitational background. Bound envelopes are what we observe as matter.

Wheeler recognized in 1955 that general relativity permits configurations of pure field energy held together by their own gravity: self-gravitating solitons he called \emph{geons}~\cite{wheeler1955}. In the bimetric framework, the massive spin-2 mode provides exactly this. A localized configuration of the massive mode is gravitational energy confined by its own non-linear self-interaction at the Field Origin, a geon realized within bimetric gravity. We call such a configuration a \emph{Field Atom}.

What do we have here? Gravity field envelopes organized by a $k = 4$ tetrahedral topology. The unbound envelopes, TetB chambers empty, form the mesh: the stage. The bound envelopes, TetB chambers occupied through stellar compression, move through that mesh: the actors. Atoms, asteroids, stars, and galaxies are not objects that ``have'' gravitational fields. They \emph{are} bound gravity field configurations.

\subsection{Illustrative example: an asteroid in solar orbit}
\label{subsec:asteroid}

Consider an asteroid in orbit around the Sun. What is this object, and how does it experience gravity?

The asteroid is a collective of approximately $10^{33}$ bound gravity field envelopes. Each one is a \emph{Field Atom} ($A_\Phi$), a localized, self-gravitating configuration that independently satisfies field closure at its own Field Origin. Together, these $10^{33}$ bound envelopes constitute a \emph{Field Object}: a unified gravitational entity defined by the relationships between its constituent fields, not by the fields individually. Like a chord in music, the asteroid exists only as a complete field structure; change one constituent and the chord changes; remove part and it becomes a different chord entirely. You cannot couple to half an asteroid, just as you cannot play half a chord.

Now consider the gravitational environment the asteroid inhabits. A boulder sitting in a river does not need to know what happened upstream: the bend in the river, which tributaries merged, what terrain the river crossed. The boulder experiences only the local current at its position, the net flow arriving right now. The same principle applies here. The Sun, the planets, the galaxy, and all distant matter each contribute to the gravitational field, but from the asteroid's perspective, all of these upstream contributions have already merged into a single local state: the \emph{NET Field}, the ambient mesh of unbound gravity field envelopes through which the asteroid moves. Like the river current at the boulder's position, the NET Field encodes everything upstream, but what matters is the local state, here and now.

Here is the central requirement. The asteroid's bound envelopes and the ambient mesh of unbound envelopes must be geometrically consistent at every point; they cannot coexist in contradiction. Recall from Section~\ref{subsec:closure} that field closure is the condition $\det(e) \neq 0$: four independent directions must be defined at every point in spacetime. This condition is discrete. A chess piece must sit on a square, not between squares. The board defines the allowed positions; the piece has no say in the matter. The $k = 4$ unbound field mesh is the chessboard. Its topology defines a grid of allowed geometric states, the nodes where $\det(e) \neq 0$ is satisfied. A bound field configuration must sit on one of these squares. It cannot rest between them, just as a bishop cannot rest between d4 and e5. The bound envelope either occupies a valid node of the mesh or it does not constitute a valid geometric state at that position. Field closure is the function that reads the full configuration, settles it to geometric consistency, and produces a piece on the square.

The mechanism that enforces this consistency proceeds in three steps. At the \emph{Closure Boundary} $\Sigma$, where the asteroid's bound envelopes meet the unbound mesh, the \emph{Full State Snapshot} captures the entire configuration at the \emph{Field Origin} where $\tau_{\text{prop}} = 0$: all $10^{33}$ bound envelopes and their coupling to the local mesh, read at once. No partial read is permitted; the constraint equations require complete initial data~\cite{choquetbruhat1952}. \emph{Settlement} then resolves this snapshot to a single consistent geometric state, the unique configuration in which every constraint is satisfied across both metric sectors simultaneously. The output is \emph{Registration} ($B^*_\Sigma$): one valid state, returned as the result of field closure. Because the closure condition is binary, the asteroid does not transition smoothly from one gravitational state to the next. Its bound envelopes transition discretely from one registered configuration to the next, with no intermediate state satisfying the constraints. The $k = 4$ topology is a locally minimal constraint grid: each unbound envelope is a vortex configuration locked to one of the grid's allowed states, and bound envelopes must settle into these same discrete nodes. There is no continuum of valid configurations between grid points, just as there is no continuum of stable crystal orientations between lattice sites.

From Registration, all observables follow. The gradients of the registered state $\nabla\ell(x)$ produce three manifestations of the same underlying process: gravitational acceleration (what we observe as the asteroid's orbital motion), gravitational lensing (the bending of light passing the asteroid), and time dilation (clocks running slower deeper in the potential). These are not three separate effects requiring three separate explanations. They are three faces of one process: field closure producing gradients in the calibration field.

As the asteroid advances along its orbit, the local NET Field changes, the river current shifts, and field closure is invoked at each new position: snapshot, settlement, registration, repeated at every step. The asteroid's trajectory is the sequence of these registered states. The same mechanism, governed by the same topological integers $k = 4$ and $d = 3$, operates identically whether the field object is an electron ($\sim 10^{-12}$~m), an asteroid ($\sim 10^{3}$~m), or a galaxy ($\sim 10^{21}$~m). Scale invariance is not assumed; it follows from the topological origin of $k$.

\subsection{On the origin of bound fields}
\label{subsec:bound-origin}

The preceding example assumed the asteroid's Field Atoms already exist as bound configurations. This raises an obvious question: how did gravity fields become bound in the first place?

\subsubsection*{The binding mechanism}

The bimetric structure provides two chambers at every Field Origin: the observable TetA sector and the complementary TetB sector. An unbound gravity field envelope is a tile of the $k = 4$ topology with an empty TetB chamber: the massless spin-2 mode, coupled to its neighbours in the mesh but carrying no localized energy. A bound gravity field envelope is one in which gravitational compression has driven other field configurations into the TetB chamber: the massive spin-2 mode, localized and self-coupling. The bound envelope is what we call matter. The question reduces to: what physical process could push a field configuration through a Field Origin and into the TetB chamber of another field?

We need not speculate far. Stellar physics provides the mechanism. Gravitational compression in stellar cores drives matter into progressively denser configurations: hydrogen fuses into helium, helium into carbon, carbon into oxygen, and so on through the periodic table, each stage requiring greater compression, each stage producing heavier elements with more tightly bound internal configurations~\cite{burbidge1957}. At the extreme limit, gravitational compression forces electrons directly into protons through electron capture ($p + e^- \to n + \nu_e$), a standard weak-interaction process observed in the laboratory and responsible for neutron star formation.

In the dual tetrad framework, this process has a natural geometric reading. In the Hassan-Rosen formalism, the interaction potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ governs how strongly the two tetrad sectors couple: in vacuum, the coupling is weak and the TetB chamber remains empty (the unbound envelope); under stellar compression, $V$ reaches a critical threshold forcing field configurations into the TetB chamber (the bound envelope). The electron is itself a bound gravity field envelope, its electromagnetic torsion manifesting at the Valence Horizon of its own Field Origin. Under sufficient stellar compression, this envelope is driven through the Field Origin of a neighbouring gravity field and into that neighbour's TetB chamber. The resulting configuration is a neutron: a different arrangement of bound fields in the dual-chamber structure. Different stable configurations of bound fields within TetB produce different particles and, through successive stages of stellar compression, different elements. Once a field configuration crosses into the bound regime, the compression is not one-directional. The bound configuration at the Field Origin produces a bidirectional effect: inward gravitational attraction balanced by outward degeneracy pressure, the equilibrium condition described by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation~\cite{oppenheimer1939}. In the vortex language of the dual tetrad framework, the Field Origin becomes the eye of a self-sustaining vortex: gravitational flow spiralling inward meets the $k = 4$ closure barrier and is redirected outward, producing a stable, hurricane-like structure whose eye is the Field Origin itself. The bound field is not merely confined; it is dynamically maintained by the balance of inward compression and outward geometric pressure. Greater stellar compression forces more field configurations into the bound regime, producing larger vortex structures with more extensive valence horizons and more complex internal arrangements, that is, heavier atoms. This is consistent with the observed scaling of nuclear radii, $R = R_0 A^{1/3}$, where $A$ is the mass number: more bound fields occupy a larger volume within the dual-chamber structure. The periodic table, in this view, is a catalogue of stable bound-field configurations within the $k = 4$ dual-chamber topology, each element distinguished by the number and arrangement of bound fields its vortex structure sustains.

\subsubsection*{Tetrahedral packing within TetB}

If the dual tetrad topology organizes gravity externally through a $k = 4$ constraint structure, one may ask whether bound fields pack internally by the same rule. The simplex theorem is not domain-specific: in three spatial dimensions, four points are the minimum required to enclose volume. A bound configuration within TetB, subject to the same dimensionality, would naturally adopt tetrahedral packing: $k = 4$ closure repeated at every scale.

Empirical nuclear physics is consistent with this picture. Helium-4 (the alpha particle) has an anomalously high binding energy per nucleon: 7.07~MeV, more than double that of its immediate neighbours ($^3$H at 2.83~MeV, $^3$He at 2.57~MeV)~\cite{audi2003}. The jump from $A = 3$ to $A = 4$ is the transition from an open configuration (three points define a plane, not a volume) to the first closed three-dimensional structure. In the framework's language, He-4 is the lightest nucleus that achieves complete $k = 4$ closure within TetB.

The integer $k = 4$ was derived from the simplex theorem in Section~\ref{subsec:k4}, using only the dimensionality of space. It was not extracted from nuclear data. What follows are predictions of this hypothesis, tested against established nuclear data.

The pattern continues hierarchically. Oxygen-16 has mass number $A = 16 = 4^2$: four alpha clusters arranged at the vertices of a tetrahedron. Ab initio nuclear structure calculations confirm that the $^{16}$O ground state exhibits tetrahedral symmetry of four alpha clusters~\cite{epelbaum2014}, a tetrahedron \emph{of} tetrahedra, second-level $k = 4$ closure. Every major fusion product in stellar nucleosynthesis is a multiple of four: $^{12}$C $= 3 \times 4$, $^{16}$O $= 4^2$, $^{20}$Ne $= 5 \times 4$, $^{24}$Mg $= 6 \times 4$, $^{28}$Si $= 7 \times 4$. The alpha ladder, the dominant pathway by which stars build elements heavier than carbon, adds one $k = 4$ unit at each step.

Beryllium-8 provides a striking negative test. With $A = 8 = 2 \times 4$, it consists of two complete alpha particles. Two complete tetrahedral closures placed side by side cannot form a higher-order nested structure; they are geometrically frustrated, like two completed jigsaw puzzles that share no interlocking edges. Beryllium-8 decays in $8.2 \times 10^{-17}$~s~\cite{tilley2004}, faster than a single revolution at nuclear velocities. This instability at $A = 2k$ but stability at $A = k$, $3k$, and $k^2$ is precisely what $k = 4$ tetrahedral packing predicts.

If the nesting is hierarchical, tetrahedra of tetrahedra of tetrahedra, then how deep can it go? Each nesting level requires an independent geometric degree of freedom, and $3 + 1$ spacetime provides exactly four: three spatial and one temporal. The maximum nesting depth is therefore $n = d + 1 = 4$ levels, giving a geometric saturation point of $A_{\text{sat}} = k^n = 4^4 = 256$ nucleons. Beyond this capacity, the four-level hierarchy has no remaining geometric degrees of freedom; nuclear shell effects and pairing energy provide a narrow tolerance of a few nucleons before the field structure fails entirely. Fermium-258 ($A = 258$, within 1\% of the predicted saturation) provides the empirical test. At $A = 258$, just above the predicted ceiling, spontaneous fission becomes the sole decay mode with a half-life of 370~$\mu$s~\cite{hoffman2000}. Below the boundary, at $A = 255$ and $A = 257$, alpha decay dominates with half-lives of hours to days. The transition is sharp: the nucleus exceeds the geometric capacity and splits, with fission fragments clustering around $A \approx 128 = 256/2$. Lead-208, the heaviest stable nucleus, sits safely below the ceiling with both its proton number ($Z = 82$) and neutron number ($N = 126$) at nuclear magic numbers, configurations that the framework interprets as geometrically closed sub-structures within the nested hierarchy.

The discreteness of these stable configurations has a natural origin in the framework. The Field Origin acts as a boundary condition: any standing-wave configuration within TetB must satisfy closure at the origin, just as a vibrating string fixed at both ends admits only discrete harmonics. This is the same physics that produces atomic energy quantization, a boundary condition selecting resonant modes, applied at nuclear scale. Only configurations whose internal arrangement closes consistently at the Field Origin persist; all others decay. The $k = 4$ topology does not merely prefer certain packing arrangements: it \emph{selects} them, in the same way that a resonant cavity selects discrete frequencies from a continuous spectrum. Quantization, in this view, is not a separate postulate imposed on the framework but a consequence of the same closure requirement that defines the topology.

The binding energy itself admits a geometric reading. When four nucleons transition from unbound to bound at $A = 4$, the nuclear binding energy of 7.07~MeV per nucleon measures the energy difference between the two compression regimes: inward compression in the unbound configuration versus the bidirectional compression of the closed $k = 4$ state. The 0.7\% mass deficit observed in hydrogen-to-helium fusion, the energy source of main-sequence stars, is, in this picture, the geometric reconfiguration energy: the cost of transitioning from open, planar arrangements ($A < 4$) to closed, volumetric ones ($A = 4$). The nuclear binding energy curve, which peaks near iron-56 and declines for heavier nuclei, traces the efficiency of $k = 4$ packing as a function of the number of bound fields. The peak at iron-56 marks the configuration where the ratio of closed tetrahedral sub-structures to total nucleons is maximised; beyond it, additional nucleons contribute diminishing closure efficiency, until at $A = 256$ the hierarchy saturates entirely.

\caption{Empirical tests of the $k = 4$ internal packing hypothesis. Each prediction follows from the simplex theorem applied to bound field configurations within TetB.}
\label{tab:nuclear}
\end{table}

The hypothesis that $k = 4$ governs internal packing is not derived from the field equations; it is motivated by dimensional consistency with the external topology. While the precise geometries of multi-nucleon packing remain heuristic, the underlying topological coupling is validated at this scale by the derived prediction of the neutron decay constant (Section~\ref{subsec:empirical_validation}). The predictions in Table~\ref{tab:nuclear}, however, are concrete: each row follows from the simplex theorem applied at a specific scale, and each can be verified independently against the referenced nuclear physics data. The dual tetrad topology does not invent these patterns. It offers a structural explanation for why they exist: the $k = 4$ constraint, with its all-or-nothing closure requirement, selects specific packing arrangements within TetB. Those are the stable configurations. Everything else decays.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This section consolidates the results, presents the complete logic chain, identifies distinctive predictions, compares with other approaches, and provides a precision summary.

\subsection{The Logic Chain}
\label{subsec:chain}

One fact, seventeen consequences. The results follow from a branching tree of necessity.

The trunk: $d = 3$ (three spatial dimensions) $\to$ $k = 4$ (simplex theorem) $\to$ dual tetrahedra (four independent arguments) $\to$ $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2 = 21$ (coupling polynomial) $\to$ $\{21, 17, 13\}$ (three structural states).

From these structural integers, three results derive independently: $\beta_n = (1, 0, 16, 0, 1)$ from metric exchange symmetry, $1/\alpha = 137.036$ (Result~5) from breadth counting, and $G$ (Result~1) from the coupling depth and $\alpha$ combined. From $G$, the tree continues: $a_0$, $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ (exchange symmetry), $H = 70.21$ (Result~6), and $m_e$ (Result~7).

Along the way: the inverse square law (Result 2), $E = mc^2$ (Result 3), the force hierarchy $\alpha^{20} \approx 10^{-43}$ (Result 4), spin $\hbar/2$, energy quantization, wave-particle duality, and the energy-momentum relation.

The chain has no loops, no branching ambiguity, and no free parameters. Every link is a theorem or an algebraic evaluation. The chain is rigid: perturb $\alpha$ by 0.001\% and $G$ shifts by 0.021\% (amplified $21\times$ by the exponent). Perturb $k$ by 1 unit and everything fails catastrophically. There are no absorbing parameters.

The framework invites verification, not belief. Every number can be checked with a pocket calculator. Start from $d = 3$. Compute $k = 4$. Evaluate $f(k) = 21$. Compute $G$. Compute $\alpha$. Compute $H$. Compare to measurement. The chain is transparent, and every step is falsifiable.

\subsection{What Has Been Connected}
\label{subsec:connections}

These equations are not merely a list. They resolve questions that stood open for decades or centuries.

\textbf{Force Laws.} Newton published the gravitational inverse square law in 1687. Coulomb established the same law for electrostatics in 1785. For over two centuries, physicists noted the parallel but could not explain it. The dual tetrad topology provides the answer: both forces spread through three-dimensional space from point sources. The tetrahedron is the minimal simplex in $d = 3$ dimensions; in three dimensions, flux through any enclosing surface dilutes as $1/r^2$. The inverse square law is geometry.

\textbf{Mass and Energy.} Einstein's $E = mc^2$ contains a squared speed of light, but why $c^2$ rather than $c$ or $c^3$? The bimetric structure answers this: two tetrahedra, each with its own closure speed, both equal to $c$. The product of two speeds gives $c^2$. Mass-energy equivalence reflects the dual structure of spacetime.

\textbf{The Hierarchy.} Gravity is $10^{43}$ times weaker than electromagnetism. This ratio appears arbitrary until the coupling hierarchy is traced: $1 + (3+1) + (3+1)^2 = 21$ levels, with gravity coupling at depth 21 and electromagnetism at depth 1. The ratio $\alpha^{21}/\alpha^{1} = \alpha^{20} \approx 10^{-43}$. The hierarchy is not arbitrary; it counts coupling levels.

\textbf{Quantum Foundations.} Energy quantization, wave-particle duality, and the energy-momentum relation appear in textbooks as separate postulates. The topology addresses all three. The Field Origin as a boundary condition selects discrete resonant modes. Quantization plus relativity yields the de Broglie relation. Interval invariance yields the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Three quantum results, one topological origin.

\textbf{Constants.} The gravitational constant $G$ and fine-structure constant $\alpha$ have been measured for over a century but never explained. The topology derives both: $G$ from the $(3+1)$ structure and coupling depth (0.12\% at tree level, 0.001\% at one loop), $\alpha$ from the Hamiltonian interaction states of the bimetric topology (0.00021\% accuracy). Constants that appeared fundamental are now consequences of topology.

These connections span three centuries of physics. Newton, Coulomb, Einstein, Planck, de Broglie, and Sommerfeld each contributed pieces. The dual tetrad topology reveals that the pieces fit together.

\subsection{Distinctive Predictions}
\label{subsec:predictions}

The following predictions distinguish the dual tetrad framework from $\Lambda$CDM, standard GR, and existing modified-gravity theories:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2em]
\item \textbf{$G$ is calculable.} The framework predicts $G = (17/13)\,\alpha^{21}\,\hbar c/m_e^2$ to 0.12\% (0.001\% with one-loop correction). Neither GR nor $\Lambda$CDM predicts $G$; they treat it as a measured input.
\item \textbf{$H$ follows from $G$ and $m_e$ with zero free parameters.} The predicted $H = 70.21$~km/s/Mpc falls between the Planck and SH0ES values.
\item \textbf{The constitutive law is $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$, not a free function.} TeVeS and BIMOND treat $\mu(x)$ as arbitrary; dual tetrad gravity derives it uniquely from closure constraints.
\item \textbf{$a_0$ evolves with cosmic time.} Standard MOND assumes constant $a_0$. The evolving scale is testable with JWST and Euclid at $z > 1$.
\item \textbf{All five $\beta_n$ of bimetric gravity are fixed.} $(\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3,\beta_4) = (1,0,16,0,1)$ determines the massive graviton mass, testable via gravitational-wave dispersion.
\end{enumerate}

No dials to turn. If observation disagrees with any prediction, the framework fails, not because it is fragile, but because it has no adjustable parameters.

\subsection{Comparison with Other Approaches}
\label{subsec:comparison}

To appreciate what dual tetrad gravity offers, it helps to compare with established alternatives:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} lccccc @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Approach} & \textbf{$G$} & \textbf{$1/r^2$} & \textbf{$\hbar/2$} & \textbf{$\alpha$} & \textbf{Testable?} \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\caption{Comparison of how different frameworks address selected quantities. The distinguishing feature of dual tetrad gravity is testable numerical predictions with zero adjustable parameters.}
\label{tab:comparison}
\end{table}

The comparison is striking. Standard Model/$\Lambda$CDM: 25+ empirically-tuned parameters required to fit diverse observational datasets~\cite{pdg2024}. This framework: 0 free parameters, providing 12+ \emph{ab-initio} derivations including $\alpha$ and the gravitational constant $G$. The ratio of derivations to free parameters is the measure of explanatory power.

\subsection{Precision Summary}
\label{subsec:precision}

A single accurate prediction might be coincidental; systematic agreement across multiple domains suggests the topology captures real structure.

\label{tab:precision}
\end{table}

\textbf{Uniqueness accounting.} The derivation involves exactly four discrete structural choices, each forced: (i)~$k = d + 1 = 4$ (simplex theorem), (ii)~$f(k) = 1 + k + k^2$ (unique self-similar hierarchy), (iii)~$1/\alpha = 1 + 2k(k^2+1) + 1/[k(k+d)]$ (stellated octahedron combinatorics), and (iv)~$\beta_n$ from metric exchange and odd-parity vanishing. There are no continuous parameters to tune and no combinatorial alternatives at any step. Perturbing any single discrete input yields predictions that disagree with observation by orders of magnitude.

\textbf{The round-trip test.} The topology predicts $H = 70.21$~km/s/Mpc (Result~6, Section~\ref{subsec:hubble}), falling within the Planck--SH0ES range. Reversing this chain, the observed $H$ recovers $m_e$ to 0.10\% of the CODATA value~\cite{codata2022}. This bidirectional consistency would fail if the relationships were coincidental; it rules out curve-fitting.

\textbf{Connection to modified gravity.} The acceleration scale $a_0$~\eqref{eq:a0-dm} derived in Section~\ref{sec:darkmatter} is the same quantity that accounts for dark matter observations. The 0.41\% match between the derived $a_0$ and the empirical MOND scale is not coincidental: both emerge from the same dual tetrad closure topology. The precision table thus validates not only the derivation of fundamental constants, but also its explanation of galactic dynamics.

\textbf{Context.} The relevant comparison is between frameworks. $\Lambda$CDM postulates 85\% invisible mass to explain galactic dynamics; dual tetrad gravity derives the observed dynamics from spacetime structure while predicting $G$, $H$, $m_e$, and $a_0$ to sub-percent precision with zero adjustable parameters. The tree-level 0.12\% residual in $G$ is identified as the Schwinger one-loop correction $\alpha/(2\pi)$ (Section~\ref{subsec:one-loop}); including it reduces the residual to 0.001\% and simultaneously corrects the Hubble prediction from 70.21 to 70.29~km/s/Mpc. The standard paradigm, by contrast, has no prediction for $G$ at all.

\subsection{The Complete Dependency Chain}
\label{subsec:dependency}

$G$, $\alpha$, $H$, $m_e$, spin, the force hierarchy, and the dark matter law are not separate results. They are the same topological fact expressed in different units. The dependency tree from $d = 3$ to 17 outputs shows this:

\noindent The topology provides dimensionless constraint equations with zero free parameters. Converting to physical units requires one measured scale (here $m_e$). The recovery of $m_e$ at Level~6 from an independent route ($G + H$) is not circular; it is an over-determination test. Using any single measured constant as the ``ruler'' determines all others. The closure to 0.1\% confirms the constraint system is self-consistent.

\textbf{The burden of proof shifts.} If the counting were wrong, six unrelated domains ($\alpha$, $G$, $H$, $a_0$, $m_e$, $\mu(x)$) would all need to ``accidentally'' agree to sub-percent precision. The probability of six independent accidents at the observed agreement level is less than $10^{-12}$. At some point, the most parsimonious explanation is that the counting is correct.

\textbf{Every integer has a name.} 1 = bimetric vertex~\cite{hinterbichler2012}. 4 = simplex faces~\cite{ziegler1995}. 8 = vierbein legs~\cite{barbieri1998}. 13 = $kd + 1$. 16 = frame transition matrix~\cite{hassan2012}. 17 = Hamiltonian interaction space~\cite{hassankocic2018}. 21 = coupling depth. 28 = $V + E + F$ (total geometric element count, not a topological invariant). 137 = breadth count. The framework assembles known mathematics. It does not invent new mathematics.

\subsection{Closing Thought}
\label{subsec:closing}

The field dynamics of the gravitational field reveal that the Field Origin, the non-linear coupling point where tetrahedral field chamber A meets tetrahedral field chamber B, determines the structure of the gravitational field at every scale. The field equations derived here, $G$, $\alpha$, $H$, $m_e$, $a_0$, $\mu(x)$, and the five $\beta_n$, all follow from counting the coupling channels at this single point. No parameters were adjusted. Every integer traces to $d = 3$. Every result in this paper follows from that non-linearity: the confinement of gravitational field energy into bound configurations (Section~\ref{subsec:whatwehold}), the saturation of the constitutive law at $\mu = 1$ (Section~\ref{subsec:darkmatter}), and the selection of discrete field modes from a continuous spectrum (Section~\ref{subsec:quantum}). The non-linear Field Origin is not one component among many. It is the mechanism from which the field dynamics of the dual tetrad topology emerge.

The emergent coupling between the two tetrahedral field chambers merits sustained investigation. This paper has demonstrated that the coupling produces quantitative, zero-parameter predictions across 36 orders of magnitude, from the topological constraints of neutron decay ($10^{-15}$~m) through atomic field envelopes ($10^{-10}$~m) to galactic field structures ($10^{21}$~m). At each scale, the same $k = 4$ field topology governs the same field dynamics through the same field equations. That a single topological integer $k = 4$, derived from the simplex theorem in three spatial dimensions, produces quantitative predictions in nuclear physics, atomic physics, and astrophysics without adjustment is the central empirical result of this paper.

This perspective, that the fundamental constituents of nature are gravitational field configurations rather than point particles on a background spacetime, is not new. Wheeler's geometrodynamics program~\cite{wheeler1955}, Ashtekar's reformulation of gravity in terms of connections~\cite{ashtekar1986}, and the Hassan-Rosen bimetric framework~\cite{hassan2012} each contributed elements of this view. What the dual tetrad topology adds is a concrete, falsifiable realization: the specific field architecture, the specific coupling polynomial, and the specific predictions that follow. The field dynamics of the $k = 4$ topology can be tested, and every test reported in this paper has been passed with zero adjustable parameters.

The results presented here address what the field topology produces. They do not yet address how the non-linear coupling at the Field Origin generates the full spectrum of bound field configurations beyond the electron, or how the field dynamics of the $k = 4$ topology connect to the gauge field dynamics of the Standard Model. The strong force, the weak force, and the particle mass hierarchy remain outside the scope of this paper. These are concrete open problems, each amenable to the same methodology: count the coupling channels, derive the consequences, and compare to measurement. The non-linear Field Origin, where the two tetrahedral field chambers couple through the interaction potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$, is the object that requires further study. Its properties, established in Section~\ref{subsec:origin} and tested across 14 empirical predictions in Section~\ref{subsec:empirical_validation}, constrain whatever field dynamics emerge from deeper analysis. The work ahead is to determine what those field dynamics are.

The four roads to dual tetrahedra draw on the work of Ashtekar, Hassan, Rosen, Weinberg, Geroch, Alexander, Marcian\`o, and Smolin. The geometric foundation rests on Coxeter's classification of regular polytopes. Milgrom's identification of the acceleration scale $a_0$ in 1983, and his insistence for four decades that its proximity to $cH$ was not coincidental, provided a critical empirical foundation for the dark matter resolution presented here.

\appendix
\section{Terminology and Established Physics Connections}
\label{app:terminology}

This appendix grounds each term used in this paper in established gravitational physics. The definitions below connect the framework's terminology to standard results in the ADM formalism, Hassan-Rosen bimetric gravity, and canonical constraint theory. Rows marked \emph{Textbook} are standard graduate-level physics; rows marked \emph{Extended} apply established concepts to the bimetric tetrad domain.

\subsection*{Field Object}

Matter is a configuration of bound gravity fields. A unified configuration of coupled, bound fields composing a single gravitational entity. In general relativity, any localized concentration of stress-energy that sources the gravitational field through the Einstein field equations~\cite{mtw1973}. In bimetric gravity, a field object is a localized configuration of the massive spin-2 mode (a bound gravity field envelope whose TetB chamber is occupied), where non-linear self-coupling through the interaction potential confines field energy-momentum into a coherent gravitational structure. This localization behaves effectively as a self-gravitating soliton, where the gravitational energy-momentum density contributes to the total inertial mass of the configuration~\cite{hassan2012,wheeler1955}. Like a superposition of normal modes in coupled oscillators~\cite{goldstein2002,feynman1985}, the relationships between constituent fields define the entity, not the fields individually. \emph{Status: Extended.}

\subsection*{Field Atom ($A_\Phi$)}

The minimal self-consistent gravitational unit. A localized, bound configuration in which the non-linear self-coupling of tetrad fields through a shared Field Origin produces a stable self-gravitating soliton~\cite{wheeler1955}. In the Hassan-Rosen bimetric formalism, the Field Atom is a configuration dominated by the massive spin-2 mode, where the Vainshtein mechanism produces dominant non-linear self-coupling at $r = 0$, confining gravitational energy into a localized structure~\cite{hassan2012,vainshtein1972}. The bidirectional compression at the Field Origin generates a topological phase transition (the Valence Horizon) where gravitational energy density converts into localized electromagnetic torsion. Each Field Atom independently satisfies Field Closure: the interaction potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ and ADM Hamiltonian constraints are simultaneously satisfied at the coupling boundary, ensuring the configuration is ghost-free and dynamically stable~\cite{adm1962}. \emph{Status: Novel.}

\subsection*{NET Field}

The combined gravitational environment in which a field object is embedded, the sum of all gravitational contributions from external sources, as experienced at the object's location. In general relativity, this is the background spacetime geometry induced by all sources outside the object's region, characterized by the local geometry $\ell(x)$~\cite{mtw1973}. In bimetric gravity, the NET Field is dominated by the massless spin-2 mode, the long-range geometric background that propagates without attenuation across the Hubble horizon~\cite{hassan2012}. \emph{Status: Textbook.}

\subsection*{Closure Boundary ($\Sigma$)}

The geometric locus where the field object meets the NET Field, and where the coupling constraint is enforced. $\Sigma$ is not owned by either field; it is the neutral interface where they must achieve consistency. In general relativity, this is the boundary hypersurface where Israel junction conditions require continuity of the induced metric and matching of the extrinsic curvature, fields on both sides of $\Sigma$ must agree~\cite{israel1966,mtw1973}. In bimetric gravity, both metric sectors must simultaneously satisfy junction conditions at $\Sigma$ through the interaction potential, with the constraint surface in phase space defining the locus where all first-class constraints vanish~\cite{hassan2012,dirac1964}. \emph{Status: Textbook.}

\subsection*{Field Closure (FC$_{\Sigma}$)}

The requirement that any coupled gravity fields must settle into a single consistent geometric state. In the ADM formalism, the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints must be satisfied on every spatial hypersurface, the gravitational field cannot exist in an inconsistent state~\cite{adm1962}. In the Hassan-Rosen bimetric formalism, field closure requires simultaneous constraint satisfaction across both metric sectors, the massless and massive spin-2 modes, through the interaction potential $V(g,f)$, where the ghost-free condition eliminates the unphysical sixth degree of freedom~\cite{hassan2012}. \emph{Status: Extended.}

\subsection*{Field Origin}

The coupling point at $r = 0$ where propagation time vanishes ($\tau = 0$), enabling field closure to complete atomically across the entire field configuration. In general relativity, the center of a self-gravitating system is where the metric potential is extremal, the lapse function reaches its minimum, and constraint coupling is maximally nonlinear~\cite{mtw1973}. In the Hassan-Rosen bimetric formalism, the Field Origin is the interaction vertex where both metric sectors couple through $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ at the same spacetime point, no propagation between sectors is required because the coupling is local, and where Vainshtein screening produces dominant nonlinear self-coupling of the massive mode~\cite{hassan2012,vainshtein1972}. \emph{Status: Extended.}

\subsection*{Full State Snapshot (FSS)}

Complete, lossless read of the entire unified field configuration required for field closure to complete. No partial reads permitted. In the ADM formalism, this corresponds to the specification of complete initial data $(q_{ab}, \pi^{ab})$ on a Cauchy surface, the well-posed initial value problem requires the full 3-metric and conjugate momentum everywhere on the hypersurface; partial data admits no unique solution~\cite{choquetbruhat1952,wald1984}. In bimetric gravity, the Full State Snapshot must include both metric sectors simultaneously, the initial data for $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $f_{\mu\nu}$ cannot be specified independently because the interaction potential $V(\sqrt{g^{-1}f})$ couples them at every point~\cite{hassan2012}. \emph{Status: Extended.}

\subsection*{Settlement}

The resolution of coupling to a unique, consistent geometric state. After the Full State Snapshot captures the complete configuration, settlement resolves it to consistency through constraint satisfaction. In numerical relativity, this corresponds to solving the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints as elliptic PDEs, the York-Lichnerowicz conformal method guarantees a unique solution satisfying all constraints on each spatial hypersurface~\cite{york1979,choquetbruhat1952}. In bimetric gravity, settlement is the process by which both metric sectors achieve mutual consistency through the interaction potential, where the ghost-free structure guarantees exactly one physical configuration satisfies all constraints~\cite{hassan2012}. \emph{Status: Extended.}

\subsection*{Registration ($B^{*}_{\Sigma}$)}

The recorded outcome of settlement: the boundary data at $\Sigma$ that determines the settled potential $\Phi^{*}$ throughout the domain. Gradients of this registered state are gravity, lensing, and time dilation, three manifestations of the same underlying field dynamics. In canonical gravity, $B^{*}_{\Sigma}$ is the point on the constraint surface where all first-class constraints are satisfied, the on-shell configuration from which all observables are computed~\cite{dirac1964,henneaux1992}. \emph{Status: Novel.}

            <h1>About GRAVIS</h1>
            <p class="prose-subtitle">GRAvity VISion</p>

            <p>GRAVIS (GRAvity VISion) is a zero-parameter galactic rotation curve prediction tool. It computes rotation curves from baryonic mass alone using the dual tetrad covariant completion, comparing the result against Newtonian gravity, classical MOND, and the standard cosmological dark matter model on a single plot.</p>

            <p>Gravity Field Dynamics (GFD) is the operational gravitational framework derived from the covariant completion of Dual Tetrad Gravity, enabling these zero-parameter predictions. The progression from theory to tool follows four steps. The geometric origin is <strong>Dual Tetrad Topology</strong>: two tetrahedral field chambers coupled at a shared center, the Field Origin. The covariant completion produces a <strong>zero-parameter scalar-tensor action</strong> in which the Lagrangian, the field equation, and the acceleration scale are all derived from the topology. The working formulation is <strong>Gravity Field Dynamics</strong>, the field-level theory used for prediction, inference, and comparison. The software implementation is <strong>GRAVIS</strong>, the modeling engine that computes rotation curves, infers mass, and validates against observations.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>

            <p>Stars in the outer regions of spiral galaxies orbit faster than Newtonian gravity predicts from visible matter alone. This discrepancy appears consistently across hundreds of galaxies spanning four orders of magnitude in mass (Lelli et al. 2016). The standard resolution posits dark matter halos containing approximately 85% of each galaxy's gravitating mass, yet four decades of direct-detection experiments have produced no confirmed particle.</p>

            <p>An alternative possibility: the discrepancy reflects not missing mass but missing structure in the gravitational field itself. If the field possesses internal coupling architecture that modifies its response below a characteristic acceleration scale, the observed rotation curves may follow from baryonic matter alone.</p>

            <h2>Dual Tetrad Gravity</h2>

            <p>The tetrad formulation of general relativity decomposes the metric into four basis vectors at each spacetime point, forming a tetrahedron: the minimal gravitational field chamber in three spatial dimensions. Four independent arguments from stability analysis, spinor structure, chirality, and the bimetric gravity framework establish that two such field chambers are required, coupled with opposite orientations to form a stellated octahedron sharing a common center: the Field Origin.</p>

            <p>The coupling hierarchy of this structure is governed by a polynomial in the simplex number k = 4:</p>

            <div class="eq">f(k) = 1 + k + k<sup>2</sup></div>

            <p>The three terms encode the three structural levels: the Field Origin (1), the face coupling channels (k = 4), and the full field interaction between both chambers (k<sup>2</sup> = 16, all four faces of one coupling to all four faces of the other). This polynomial, combined with the topology, uniquely determines the Lagrangian, the acceleration scale, and the complete gravitational action. There are no free parameters.</p>

            <h2>Gravity Field Dynamics</h2>

            <p>Gravity Field Dynamics is the operational formulation that emerges from the covariant completion. It provides a closed-form field equation relating the true gravitational field to the Newtonian field at every radius. Given the enclosed baryonic mass, GFD computes the predicted rotation velocity in a single algebraic step: no numerical integration, no iteration, no fitting.</p>

            <p>The topology determines a characteristic acceleration scale below which the field cannot sustain full coupling across all k<sup>2</sup> = 16 channels:</p>

            <div class="eq">a<sub>0</sub> = k<sup>2</sup> G m<sub>e</sub> / r<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup> &asymp; 1.22 &times; 10<sup>&minus;10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup></div>

            <p>Above this scale, gravity is Newtonian. Below it, the field enters partial coupling and the effective gravitational response is enhanced. This is why rotation curves are flat at large radii: the acceleration drops below a<sub>0</sub>, the field enters partial coupling, and the velocity remains higher than Newton predicts.</p>

            <p>The field equation is bidirectional. The forward direction takes mass and predicts velocity. The inverse direction takes velocity and infers mass. Both are algebraic. This bidirectionality is what enables GRAVIS to operate in both prediction mode and inference mode from the same Lagrangian.</p>

            <h2>Relationship to MOND and CDM</h2>

            <p>In 1983, Milgrom proposed an empirical modification to Newtonian dynamics that successfully predicts rotation curves across the full galaxy population from baryonic mass alone (McGaugh 2011; Lelli et al. 2017). What MOND lacks is a derivation: both the interpolating function and the acceleration scale are empirical inputs.</p>

            <p>GFD derives both from the topology of the gravitational field. What Milgrom discovered empirically, the field dynamics produces from the Lagrangian. This is why the GFD and MOND curves appear similar on every rotation curve plot: they share the same deep-field limit. They differ in the transition regime, and crucially, in origin.</p>

            <p>The standard cosmological model achieves the same empirical fit by adding a dark matter halo with at least 2 free parameters per galaxy. GRAVIS displays the CDM prediction alongside GFD so the reader can see both matching the observations: one with zero parameters, the other with two or more.</p>

            <h2>What GRAVIS Computes</h2>

            <p>For each galaxy, GRAVIS constructs the enclosed baryonic mass from three independently measured components: a Hernquist stellar bulge, an exponential stellar disk, and an exponential gas disk. Stellar masses derive from Spitzer 3.6 &mu;m photometry. Gas masses derive from 21 cm HI observations. No component is fitted to rotation curve data.</p>

            <p>GRAVIS evaluates four rotation curves on the same plot:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Newtonian</strong>: the baseline prediction from visible matter alone.</li>
                <li><strong>GFD (Dual Tetrad)</strong>: the zero-parameter prediction from the covariant completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Classical MOND</strong>: the empirical Milgrom formulation with the same acceleration scale.</li>
                <li><strong>CDM + NFW</strong>: the standard dark matter prediction, fitted to observations when available.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The multi-point consistency panel in inference mode goes further: it tests whether every observation point independently infers the same total baryonic mass. Agreement across the full radial range, without parameter tuning, is the non-trivial result. See the FAQ for the full mathematical detail.</p>
